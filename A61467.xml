            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98328:4"/>of heaven; or the fear of hell, then the love, or the terrour of their Maker. Wherefore if this my weak and imperfect labour ſhall be any waies ſerviceable for the diſcovery of thy maladies, and the recovery of thy health, or in any reſpect inſtrumentall to thy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall welfare, I have the deſired fruit and reward thereof, and let glory be given unto him, to whom alone it doth of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
               <p>It was once the happineſſe and glory of thy children, that they had Paſtours both learned and faithfull, inſtructors peaceable as well as pure, who adorned the truth of their Doctrine with the holineſſe of their converſation, and were carefull to preſerve thy unity no leſſe inviolable, then that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt.

<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.4.</note> and as the early dew it went away:</hi> And thy <hi>glory</hi> like that of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> did <hi>flie away like a bird, from the birth,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.11.</note> and from the womb, and from the conception.</hi> For the leaders of thy people ſoon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98328:5"/>cauſed them to erre, and thy chief ſhepherds ſent forth unskilfull and blinde guides among them, who knew not the way of their ſteps, or ſuch who loved to wander themſelves; and by their lewd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample drew others aſide from the paths of righteouſneſſe and of peace; or thoſe who were ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and cared not for the flock, but for the fleece only, preferring their own bodily eaſe to the welfare of their brethrens moſt precious ſouls, and the ſhort pleaſure of ſin to the laſting comfort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: yea how many of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did love to have it ſo, that there might be like Prieſt like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and being corrupted by long proſperity and peace, or prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with pride, worldly intereſt, covetouſneſſe and deſire of gain, or blinded with paſſion and prejudice againſt their Teachers, or glutted with the common uſe and plenty of their ſpirituall Manna, they could no longer endure ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or thoſe who taught is as the truth is in Jeſus. But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98328:5"/>
                  <hi>after their own luſts,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.3.</note> heaped to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves teachers, having itching ears:</hi> who well perceiving the levity and inconſtancy of ſome, the pride and wantonneſſe of others, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of hypocriſie with the ſpirit of contradiction and contention in all in thought it now no time to ſleep, but made uſe of ſo fair an opportunity and gratefull ſeaſon of arriving to the haven of their reſpective deſires and hopes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of them ſtrake ſayle for their ambition, others for their covetouſneſſe, and not a few for their diſcontent and malice againſt the preſent government and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; although it was not poſſible only, but probable alſo, that ſome at leaſt had <hi>a zeal of God</hi> in tais ſtrange act of oppoſition and gainſaying, but <hi>not according to knowledge.</hi> As for the reſt, the contempt and reproach which lay on them, whether for their poverty (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is ſeldome or never without diſgrace in flouriſhing and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times) or for the ſuſpicion of being factious and diſaffected to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98328:6"/>then ruling power, and unequall adminiſtration of juſtice and law, both in Church and State (the ſure fore-runner of national calamities) was no ſmall incentive to ſet them on with greedineſſe in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and courſes, the ſad effects whereof we ſee and feel unto this preſent day.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the generall pretence and profeſſion of all is, that they deſire and aim at nothing more, yea, at nothing beſides, then the true doctrine and diſcipline of Chriſt Jeſus, eſpecially the latter. And to this ſpecious deſigne an open way ſeemed to be made by the great profaneneſſe and vicious living of the oppolite party, who while they were zealous for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the ordinances of men, and thought a main part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty to depend upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them, did allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carnall liberty in violating the precepts and commandements of God. And this they did as from that inbred corruption which is common to all men: ſo likewiſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98328:6"/>from a private ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the adverſaries of their cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thus while ſome were zealous indeed for the outward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall diſcipline of thy ſons, but cold or lukewarm in the profeſſion and maintenance of thy doctrine, or denying it by their works, though they did confeſſe it with their lips: other zealous (at leaſt in ſhew) for thy doctrine, but ſlighting thy diſcipline, or zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly bent againſt it, even to a diſtemper ſometimes of rage and violence, and the greater part reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quiet in an indifferent or neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall diſpoſition and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both, <hi>the ſtaves</hi> of <hi>beauty</hi> and of <hi>bands,</hi> were ſoon cut quite aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and broken in pieces; even the covenant of truth, order, and peace, with the entire bond of Chriſtian brotherhood; whereby many have made ſhipwrack of the faith and of good conſcience to the extreme hazard of their immortall ſouls. And many more are like to fall daily after the ſame example of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98328:7"/>misbelief, errour and Apoſtaſie. For what other fruits may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from thoſe roots of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which have ſprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; I mean the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diviſions of thy children which have <hi>troubled</hi> our peace, and whereby ſo <hi>many are defiled:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.15. Jam. 3.16.</note> ſeeing that <hi>where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evill work?</hi> The truth of which hath been for a long time exemplified not only in their ſtrange diſorder and chaos-like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all things, but alſo in their cruell demeanour and more then barbarous practiſes one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, no leſſe hatefull to God the author of order, unity, and peace, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, then pernicious to men created after his own image and likeneſſe. And however more pretend to holineſſe now then in former times, (And this indeed is the very ſoul of our Chriſtian profeſſion) few of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary prudence and conſcience are ſo weak ſighted that they cannot look through their thin vail or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98328:7"/>fine web of hypocriſie, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern this <hi>form of godlineſſe</hi> from the <hi>power thereof.</hi> For albeit they have the <hi>voice of Jacob,</hi> and would be thought thereby to have the <hi>heart of Jacob</hi> alſo: yet the <hi>rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of their hands, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>hunting,</hi> evidently ſhew, that there is in them the <hi>profaneneſſe</hi> and <hi>cruelty of Eſau,</hi> who for one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of meat <hi>ſold his birth-right,</hi> and then purpoſed with himſelf to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> it again with the price of his <hi>Brothers bloud.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But what was the cauſe that they ſo carefully put on the outward diſguiſe and mask of holineſſe? Surely, to omit the great repute which they gained by this means at a very cheap rate with thoſe of their own opinion and faction, and thoſe high titles of ſingularity and ſpirituall preheminence above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the world (generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by them as wicked and reprobate perſons, becauſe not of their ſociety and fellowſhip) the which they uſually received from their chieftains and leaders as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98328:8"/>belonging to themſelves and their diſciples, and thoſe worldly advantages (to ſay no more) which privately at leaſt attended on their novell profeſſion: This perchance was not the meaneſt, that they might thus check and ſhame the open profaneneſſe, groſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, irreligion, and ſinne of their profeſſed adverſaries: the which (to ſpeak the truth) was ſo eminent oft-times, and notorious in many of them, as might ſtartle a meer naturall conſcience to hear or behold it; and cauſe therein an abhorrency from their courſes (ſo oppoſite as well to right reaſon as to ſanctifying grace) much more in a minde enlightned, though with the ſmalleſt ray of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall truth. For what could be more ſtrange or hatefull unto men, in whom was any ſpark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining either of common Grace, or of morall Vertue; and who were not wholly poſſeſſed with Atheiſme, and carryed on with fulleſt bent to Libertiniſme and ungodly practiſe; then to hear thoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98328:8"/>that did profeſſe themſelves to be the followers of Chriſt, to have communion with him by faith, and to expect glory from him, ſcoffing at the pureſt acts of his worſhip, blaſpheming or profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his holy Name by cauſleſſe oathes, fearfull imprecations, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full execrations, and ſuch like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, not to be expreſſed again without horrour and amazement; and not only ſo, but glorying like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in this their abominable wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and in other of like dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature, namely,

               <p>In the mean time, how much did this their apparent and over daring impudence in ſin commend and grace the ſeeming Saint-like
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98328:9"/>converſation of their adverſaries? Many of which, notwithſtanding all their glorious profeſſion and ſhew of godlineſſe, were no better then thoſe <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> againſt whom our bleſſed Saviour cloth denouounce ſo many curſes for their inward hypocraſie and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty veiled with the ſpecious dreſſe of outward ſanctity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. ſee eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially verſ. 27, 28. &amp; <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. where ſee verſ. 39, 44.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98328:9"/>with the corrupt fruits and effects which proceed from theſe, very rife and ordinary amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As for ſome who gave them the right hands of fellowſhip, we cannot without manifeſt breach of charity, judge of them otherwiſe then that they were ſimple, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and well meaning men, who being offended (and not without cauſe) at the corruption of the times, and ſcandalous lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the ſacred office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and deluded by the fair ſpeeches, good words, ſmooth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, plauſible pretences of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aims and ends, (not warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only, but neceſſary alſo) of thoſe who made it their buſineſſe to cauſe diviſions and offences between thy children, were drawn firſt into a diſlike of thy policy, and afterward to a ſeparation from thee, if not in appearance, yet in heart, though at laſt in both, when it was more ſafe and advantagious then before. And indeed their ſtrict conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in other reſpects to the precepts of the Goſpell with their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98328:10"/>in ſuffering for the defence of their cauſe, did argue as much to moderate men, and not poſſeſſed with prejudicate hatred of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and perſons; for ſuch as theſe could never be induced to entertain a good conceit of them, no not in the leaſt meaſure: but contrariwiſe judged their beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be counterfeit and falſe, and thought their greateſt ſufferings to proceed from pride and contumacy of ſpirit, rather then from blinde ignorance of the truth, or from errour of conſcience: Now as it comes to paſſe between thoſe who extremely hate one the other, that they endevour as much as in them lyeth, to be unlike each the other in their manner of life, outward behaviour, garbe, and faſhion, and every thing for the moſt part which is pleaſing to the one is diſpleaſing to the other, and oft-times for this reaſon only, becauſe his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary taketh delight therein: ſo it fared in this caſe; for what the one party did approve and allow of in their practiſe, the other would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98328:10"/>diſlike and condemn upon this weak and cauſleſſe ground; and in like manner perchance as readily receive and embrace what the other did refuſe and reject, for the ſame reaſon, or indeed rather want of reaſon: For what can be more ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall, yea ſenſleſſe and abſurd, then for men to eſteem or vilifie, love or hate any thing, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worth or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe thereof, not as it may be uſefull or hurtfull in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them, but in oppoſition to others, without due diſcretion or judgement had of the matter in queſtion, or thing, what and how it is or may be in it ſelf, to account it vile becauſe they have a good opinion or honourable conceit thereof, and for no other reaſon to deteſt and loath it, then for that their enemies fancy or bear a liking to it? Firſt loving or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and afterward ſearching out (if poſſible) rationall motives and arguments, to give a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of either to the world. And yet ſuch was the condition of theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98328:11"/>bitter and eager adverſaries, as may appear by the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>For to begin with the received <hi>ſet form of Prayer and Liturgy</hi> (once generally uſed in the Aſſemblies of thy people for the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Maker, though ſince become through the ſubtle malice of Satan the main bait of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and laſting contentions) what could have been more profitably deviſed for the inſtruction of the ignorant then this? What more conducing to order and peace then it in a ſetled Church? What more inoffenſive and harmleſſe then the rites and ceremonies thereof? What leſſe obnoxious to any juſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuperſtition, errour, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, or abſurdity? And yet notwithſtanding, the groſſer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the vulgar people is ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or chiefly imputed unto it by the oppoſite party, together with the generall profaneneſſe of life, and meer externall formality in the acts of piety and devotion eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where conſpicuous in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98328:11"/>And it hath been thought by ſome a ſufficient ground not of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration only from the unity of thy body; but of war alſo between thy members, even unto rapine, ſpoyle, conflagration, and bloud; at leaſt a fair pretence for theſe and like courſes not inferiour to them. Beſides this, it is too well known what large accuſations have been brought againſt it by many, of Idolatry, will-worſhip, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, tautologie, indecency, inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, redundancy in ſome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in other parts thereof, and what not, which might in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpec: detract from the worth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or make it contemptible and odious with the people? To omit the taunts and reproaches, which were uſually caſt upon the orders and ceremonies thereof, and the great indignities offered to the perſons of them, who according to their conſcience, office, and duty, maintained it by their preaching and practiſe. All which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the conſideration of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, moderate and peaceable men,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98328:12"/>were judged by them to be nothing elſe then the fruits of giddy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or of diſtemper in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in zeal. And indeed he that ſhall but indifferently weigh and examine the reaſons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which the diſſenting and ſeparating brethren alledge againſt the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> will finde them for the moſt part ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid and weak, that one ſtrong argument may be drawn from hence to prove it lawfull, becauſe whatſoever hath been hitherto brought by way of reproof to evince the unlawfulneſſe thereof, hath had in it no greater ſtrength of reaſon and demonſtration, very requiſite in a cauſe ſo important as this, and in a charge ſo furious as was made againſt it. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſon and truth were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their cauſe, the opinion and confidence of both reſting on their ſide, was ſo deeply rooted in them, that I verily beleeve it would be an hard matter to finde any ſect either modern or antient, who have more obſtinately adhered to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98328:12"/>their principles, or more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently proſecuted their deſignes then they. As if they had been acted with a ſpirit of infallibility, and carried on thereby in theſe proceedings, when that of errour, contrariety, and ſpleen againſt the adverſe party, ſeemeth to have been their chief, if not only guide, wherefore they oppoſe themſelves with might and main againſt the eſtabliſhed order of <hi>prayer and diſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;</hi> and to diſgrace and depreſſe the former, they highly commend, and above meaſure extoll, and likewiſe uſe upon all occaſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditate, or (as ſome term it) <hi>conceived prayer:</hi> (A very forcible engine raiſed by them againſt Church-conformity, and in all likelihood that which hath more upheld, ſtrengthened, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their faction then any one means whatſoever) honouring it with the glorious title of <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> and that by way of propriety, in oppoſition to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any ſet form of words compoſed beforehand, or framed to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98328:13"/>our ordinary uſe. As if the Spirit of God did immediately ſuggeſt unto their mindes both the matter and form, ſenſe and words of theſe their ſupplications, but was not aſſiſtant to the other, or the other inconſiſtent with the grace and help thereof: whereas upon due ſearch into the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point, we ſhall finde this pretended praying by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not to be ſo much as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned therein: and for this cauſe at the beſt but warrantable and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us by the generall rule of indifferent things, the which are left to the judgement of Chriſtian prudence to be done or omitted by us, as we ſhall ſee it moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our ſelves or for other men, not of neceſſary uſe (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſuppoſe and maintain) ſeeing that they cannot produce any expreſſe or implicite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the ſame out of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God. For although mention be made there <hi>of prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.18.</note> yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be proved either by that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98328:13"/>precedeth, or by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the Text, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth mean by this form of ſpeech, the ſame kinde of praying which they ſo much magnifie and contend for. But rather he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth by <hi>prayer in the Spirit,</hi> that in which the hearty affection is joyned with the mouthes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the deſire of the ſoul is anſwerable to the poſiture and devotion of the body (ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9.) or that aſſiſtance of the Spirit whereof he ſpeaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. Otherwiſe the Apoſtle in this place, and by theſe words doth ſhew what it is <hi>to pray alwaies,</hi> namely, not to be continually muttering prayers with our lips, (as ſome have vainly imagined) but to be in a perpetual diſpoſition of the heart towards this holy exerciſe, yea, and to be aſſiduous and conſtant in deſire of thoſe things which we want, without ſlothfull intermiſſion or faith leſſe fainting in caſe we do not perceive a ſudden grant of our requeſts;
<note place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note> either of which is farre different
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98328:14"/>from the former, as appeareth at the very firſt ſight thereof: And yet how great advantage have they gotten upon their adverſaries by their facility of utterance and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſpeech in prayer without thought (as they profeſſe) and premeditation in the leaſt meaſure of what they were to ſay? Many of which, though learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men, either becauſe they were ill affected to this practiſe, or for that they did not exerciſe their gifts and parts this way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling, or unable to match them at this weapon, which they had been taught to handle and wield as they liſted from their tender years; were ſcorned of them, and traduced to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort as meer naturall men, not having the Spirit of God; whereof they did pretend this to be a ſure note and character. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed if we offer up our prayers unto God from a pure heart with ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvency of affection, it matters not, whether we do it in a ſet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98328:14"/>form, or by ſodain ejaculation: Provided that we aske things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the minde and will of God, entertain no thought in our ſelves, that the one is better then the other abſolutely conſidered, or more acceptable in it ſelf with him, approach with reverence both of body and of ſoul to the throne of Grace, and utter words beſeeming the Majeſty and holineſſe of him, with whom we have to doe.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall only take a view of one exception which hath been frequently alledged in my hearing, againſt the received form of Church prayer (knowing how much hath already been ſaid, and that effectually in defence thereof by men eminent for learning and piety) and ſo conclude this point. And it is the very ſame which I have formerly mentioned: namely, that by the uſe of this ſervice men were generally nurſed and brought up in groſſe ignorance, profaneneſſe, and formality of Religion. The which exception
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98328:15"/>if it were juſt or true, who could doubt, but that the Liturgy was to be exploded out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as impious in it ſelf, and therefore unlawfull to be uſed at any hand? But that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groundleſſe and falſe, might be made manifeſt by ſeverall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proving the contrary; one ſhall ſuffice for the preſent, which is taken from the ſubſtance or matter contained therein. For this being either ſome part or portion of the word of God, faithfully interpreted according to the Analogie of Faith and minde of the holy Ghoſt in all things which concern our ſalvation, or what may be deduced from it by rational conſequence, or that which doth no way contradict and thwart the precepts thereof, how can it poſſibly be a cauſe or means of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and profaneneſſe to the which it is ſo oppoſite, unleſſe light may produce darkneſſe, heat cold, and good evill? How then came it to paſſe that very many who had the continuall uſe and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98328:15"/>benefit of this form, were ſo groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the myſteries of godlineſſe, ſo diſſolute in their life and ſo formall in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as they were throughout this whole nation? Surely not becauſe this was a covert to their eyes that they could not ſee the light, or a flie poſtern gate, opening a way privily unto ſin, or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (as they falſly do imagine) but from the corruption of mens hearts,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> whereby it is that <hi>they love darkneſſe rather then light beeduſe their deeds are evill;</hi> and content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a meer ſhew, or ſlight touch at the furtheſt of Religion, as being moſt agreeable with fleſh and bloud by reaſon of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eaſineſſe which is therein, and the liberty it doth indulge unto thoſe luſts which are moſt common and predominant in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; whereas the ſincere and practicall profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth confine and reſtrain our unbridled affections, locks up our wandring deſires, and ties the knot hard upon our looſe pleaſures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98328:16"/>and delights, obliging us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and auſterity of life, and therefore doth it generally diſtaſt with men, and univerſally with all whoſe hearts are not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with true ſanctifying grace, or (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.9.</note> 13.9.) <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is too well known how little care hath been taken by thoſe who had the overſight of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to inform them concerning the uſe and end of their publique devotions, and of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall rites pertaining to the ſame, or make them underſtand the ſenſe and ſignification of thoſe things which were ſo often inculcated into their ears by others, or which themſelves uttered with their lips: yea not a few of their teachers were ſo forſaken of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and deſtitute of exemplary holyneſſe, (notwithſtanding their place and function did require eminency of both) that either they were unable to inſtruct their charge aright, or what they taught
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98328:16"/>them carryed no weight of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or authority with it, but rather was the leſſe eſteemed of by the people for their ſakes who did commend the ſame unto them, being witneſſes of their levity and ſin, and of their continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe farre diſſerent from their own profeſſion and doctrine. And yet ſuch was the force of cuſtome with many, joyned with ignorance and indiſcretion of the nature of things, that they verily thought every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Common-prayer-book, and every ceremony preſcribed thereby, to be of no leſſe then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, and that a ſlight perfunctory uſe of its forms in praying with the other rules and directions of externall worſhip obſerved by them, was ſufficient to bring them unto heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe.</p>
               <p>To this we may adde the remiſſe and ſlack hand of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline as another main cauſe of the generall ignorance and profaneneſſe of theſe times, which reached no farther for the moſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98328:17"/>part to the inferiour Clergie (how peccant ſoever otherwiſe) in the exerciſe thereof, then in point of diſconformity to Epiſcopall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Provinciall or Synodicall conſtitutions, touching externall government: neither did it call the people to a due account (if any) of their proficiency in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus, or cenſure them for non-proficiency therein, yea ſcarcely for groſſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous crimes, if they were perſons known to be well affected towards the preſent government, though upon the weakeſt perchance and worſt grounds which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; namely, the defects and failings of thoſe who did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſame.</p>
               <p>In like manner the ſleeping or not executing of neceſſary penall ſtatutes upon offenders againſt the Law of God, hath been a chief cauſe of open profaneneſſe in the land: for had theſe been imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally executed upon every convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſgreſſor, after ſome care taken to finde them out, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98328:17"/>by this time we ſhould not have ſeen many drunkards, or heard many ſwearers throughout this whole populous Hand. And indeed I can ſpeak it upon my own knowledge, that a town of good note in the Weſtern parts of the the Land not far diſtant from the Sea, heretofore famed for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of riot and diſorder, by this courſe of late years hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to that order and diſcipline, that it is a rare matter to ſee a man there at any time diſtempered with wine or with ſtrong drink, or to hear a raſh oath proceed from any mans mouth, no not when there is moſt frequent concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thither from all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts: ſo carefull are men to keep the Law, where (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.)
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience receiveth a juſt recompenſe of reward.</hi> So eaſie a matter is it for Miniſters and Officers, mutually conſpiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame work, to reform a city or town as they liſt, and proportionably a whole nation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98328:18"/>under the chief Magiſtrate, if he interpoſe not againſt it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is reported of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> that in her progreſſe viſiting the county of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> with a <hi>Miniſter</hi> next to his body, ſaid, ſhe had oftentimes demanded of her Councell, why her County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was better governed then any other County, but never underſtood the reaſon thereof till now: It muſt needs be ſo (ſaid ſhe) where the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> goe together. But what may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect when both theſe comply not, or jarre one with another? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had this one courſe alone been taken for the ſuppreſſing of common and odious ſins, there needed not to have been ſo loud a cry for a reformation in the midſt of thy people; nor ſo much of thy childrens bloud ſhed like water round about thy cities, and within the gates, and alſo on the furrowes of the field, in proſecution of this ſpecious deſign, which can hardly be compaſſed, if at all in any wiſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98328:18"/>by means ſo unproportionate as theſe to the end for which they are appointed by thoſe who would be maſter builders in this work.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the great and common neglect of teaching the younger ſort, and educating them in a Catecheticall way of doctrine and inſtruction, as it occaſioned at firſt the blinde ignorance, open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe, and meer formality in this Nation: ſo it hath ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and fomented the ſame unto this preſent day. And from hence we ſhall draw another inſtance to ſhew the great force which enmity and oppoſition do gain in the mindes of men to hinder a mutuall conſent and joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence together in thoſe waies which tend to life and godlineſſe. For what could more conduce to the furtherance and encreaſe of ſacred knowledge, to the effectuall planting and growth of piety in the hearts of Chriſtian youth, then this neceſſary and profitable means of inſtitution, ſo much commended by the divine Spirit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98328:19"/>of God to our imitation and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

And yet the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the oppoſite party could never (for ought as I can learn) be induced to entertain a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, at leaſt ſo far as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to embrace the counſell, and ſubmit to the judgement of their ſuperiors therein, notwithſtanding the viſible and apparent benefit thereof, and nothing might be reaſonably ſaid againſt it. And what was the cauſe of this? Surely in all probability the ill affection and hatred which they bore againſt the Biſhops, who did alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and preferre it to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriour brethren in the Miniſtery as more needfull and profitable for the people then their claborate and painfull preaching (ſo much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98328:19"/>magnified by their Diſciples above other Ordinances, and who could not be pleaſed without a double portion thereof every Lords day) although (as ſome object againſt them) with too great limitation and reſtraint, but however, better thus, then not at all. For (as a chief Ruler well obſerved of thy children) the omiſſion of this ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall way of inſtruction, and the cuſtome of notionall teaching (in which was more plenty of words then of matter) have given occaſion to the Apoſtaſie or falling back of ſo many from thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſome to Popiſh ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, others to Monaſterian confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while after many years ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and therefore unprofitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, they were like <hi>raſae tabulae,</hi> or unſealed wax, apt to receive any impreſſion or forme of doctrine whatſoever.

               <p>But what help and remedy can be found to cure the preſent, or prevent the future growth of this almoſt generall contagion? For although ſome have attempted now at length to put the ſame in practiſe for this very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: yet they could not bring it to paſſe according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, partly through the pride and arrogancy of ſome, much ſlighting (and yet as much wanting) this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour kinde of inſtruction; partly through the baſhfulneſſe and ſhame of others, conſcious to themſelves of more ignorance then did become their riper age, or Chriſtian edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and partly through that laxe and boundleſſe liberty which theſe times allow to all men in point of duty and conſcience, whereby every one doth gratifie his own will and humour in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, holding that in opinion which ſeemeth to him beſt, and doing that in order hereunto which liketh him moſt; in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98328:22"/>mean time rejecting the counſell and direction of thoſe who were over them in the Lord, and both able and willing to afford them ſpirituall help for the furtherance of their faith and ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>A third inſtance I ſhall take from the Anniverſary <hi>faſt of Lent,</hi> and other weekly faſts or daies of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from fleſh: the originall of which I ſhall not now diſpute, becauſe it hath been already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently done by many, the uſe I ſhall breifly examine, yet not the <hi>civill</hi> (which is manifold perchance, and much concerning the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of humane ſociety) but that which is <hi>religious</hi> or tending thereunto, and this no farther then may ſerve my preſent purpoſe, knowing how far men much more learned then my ſelf, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with this way have travelled therein. The uſe then of theſe faſts in order to devotion, is the chaſtening of the fleſh, or as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Keeping under the body, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98328:22"/>bringing it into ſubjection,</hi> namely, to the Law of the Spirit, by ſobriety and abſtinence, as appeareth from verſ. 25. See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27.
<note place="margin">verſ. 25.</note> Now that this diſcipline and exerciſe of the body is very profitable for the ſubduing and maſtering of thoſe corrupt luſts, and inordinate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of concupiſcence which do evermore accompany the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of our fleſh and fulneſſe thereof, experience as well as Scripture doth manifeſt unto us. For where do we finde more laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe, wantonneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of deſire: where do we ſee more levity, and looſneſſe of behaviour, then in great houſes abounding with wealth and plenty of all things? where there is idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fulneſſe of bread, riotous eating of fleſh and drinking of wine, tables continually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with coſtly diſhes, and ſuperfluous varieties of meat, the choiſeſt dainties which ſea or land can afford at the ſeverall ſeaſons of the year, theſe miniſtring fuell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, and as it were oyle unto
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98328:23"/>the flame of ſinfull luſt and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſoul to ſpirituall watchfulneſſe and ſobriety, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34 On the contrary, they who feed ſparingly, and drink moderately, and in ſtead of groſſe diet uſe that which is ſlender, and leſſe cheriſheth the body, eſpecially at certain ſeaſons, and ſometimes impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the harder task of abſtinence from meat, or ſaſting, are in no wiſe ſubject as the former to the deſires and motions of evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eupiſcence, and experimentally finde in themſelves a better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition both of body and of minde to the worſhip and ſervice of their Maker. And however we can in no reſpect commend, or approve of the Faſts of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as being too ſhort for the time, and ſerving rather to ſharpen and prepare the appetite for the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Feaſt, then to bridle and chaſtiſe it: for as much as after a ſlight forbearance of meat, they proceed to the dainties of a luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious banquet: (and therefore as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98328:23"/>I am informed, the <hi>Germane</hi> nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity heretofore thought no time more convenient for to viſit their Biſhops, then their Faſting daies, as affording them better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ordinary) yet thoſe Faſts wherein we truly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly afflict our ſouls before the Lord, are very commendable and uſefull exerciſes of piety and devotion. But notwithſtanding thus much and much more may be ſaid in the defence and commendation of regular and well ordered Faſts, (in which hypocriſie is not added to ſuperſtition, as in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> practiſe, and an abſolute neceſſity of obſervation with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of merit affixed to them, as in their doctrine) and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſet times appointed for this uſe: the Antiepiſcopall party could never be brought to conceit well of Church Faſting daies, much leſſe to have them in eſteem, or to keep them as the reſt of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did. But expreſſed an utter diſlike of them upon all occaſions, where they might utter their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98328:24"/>thoughts with ſafety; and ſo far were they from obſerving them according to order, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at leaſt would take theſe daies to chuſe, for the eating of fleſh and for more then uſuall feeding, in oppoſition, no doubt, to the Biſhops and their party, who were ſometimes very hot and zealous in preſſing the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſame on the inferior and middle ſort of people; ſome whereof, and thoſe not a few, had them in the greater eſteem for this reaſon, becauſe the other did vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and deſpiſe them, yea therefore aſcribed a kinde of morall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to meer bodily abſtinence from meat without any addition of inward ſpirituall devotion to it: an opinion of very dangerous conſequence, though unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of thoſe with whom it reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>A fourth inſtance we ſhall bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the cuſtome of <hi>genuflexion</hi> or bowing of the knee to God, in our common ſupplications and prayers; the which though in times
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98328:24"/>paſt obſerved with awfull diligence of thoſe who came into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and of neceſſary uſe ſtill in our devotions, when no juſt cauſe doth diſcharge us from it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may excuſe our omiſſion thereof, as being commended by by God himſelf, and commanded unto us, by the exemplary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of his Saints in all ages, yea, and of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, when he lived on the earth, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 95.6, 7.</note> with 7. (where the reaſon or argument alledged for the action, is worth our ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.29.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39. Luk. 22.41.</note> with <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. hath been for a long time intermitted as needleſſe and ſuperfluous by many of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelaticall brethren, who can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no thing of weight, or which hath in it the leaſt ſhew of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ground for it, but have been led herein as in other things by their own will, or rather wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in oppoſition to their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. And whereas men generally uſed at their firſt entrance into the Church to addreſſe themſelves by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98328:25"/>private prayer to the Almighty for preparedneſſe, no doubt, and aſſiſtance from him in his publick ſervice, witneſſing the inward devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſouls by this humble poſiture of their bodies: now for the moſt part they ruſh into the Aſſembly with leſſe reverence then they uſually do into the houſes of their familiar friends, at leaſt of thoſe who are in any degree ſuperiour to them; and what is yet more ſtrange, they deride and ſcoffe at others who approach with religious manners, to the ſolemn performance of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and againſt common ſenſe would be thought and pretend themſelves to be greater Saints by far then the other in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, becauſe more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent in their behaviour then they at the ſame time in the ſight of men, as if the religious demeanure of the body on this occaſion, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the holy diſpoſition of the minde, and not rather ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to it, and expreſſive thereof; or as though we could not honour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98328:25"/>the Lord with the former without ſuperſtition in the latter. And however we have great cauſe to fear it of many, and they boldly charge as much upon their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faries account, that they did chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not wholly, place the worſhip of God in this exteriour or bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think they have ſufficient cauſe to omit or reject the uſe thereof: yet this doth no more free them from this tye of outward ſervice, then a greater obligation doth exempt us from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a leſſe, according to that of our bleſſed Saviour in another caſe,
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> Each duty claiming from us its due eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our obedience neceſſary to both, without preferring the leſſe to the greater, or in honour to the greater, deſpiſing, or laying aſide the leſſe. For no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God may be ſlighted by us in any caſe, how ſmall ſoever; neither may we count the leaſt unworthy of our obſervation;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98328:26"/>ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. Now as we do plainly perceive from what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, the cauſleſſe prejudice of this active and violent party againſt thoſe who differ from them in judgement and practiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the holy things aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: ſo we may take notice withall of the high conceit which they entertain of themſelves in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the publick ſervice of God, appearing by their forbearing to invocate his name for his grace and aſſiſtance in this weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe after the received manner in the congregation, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting thoſe externall actions and geſtures of the body, whereby alone they can teſtifie unto men the internall reverence and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoul, as though they were in a continuall preparedneſſe or readineſſe for the acts of divine worſhip, or needed not the ſame with other men, at leaſt not thoſe means commonly uſed by them for this end and purpoſe, as being improper for men of their ſtamp and unbeſeeming ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98328:26"/>were, who had attained to a greater meaſure both of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and of ſanctity then the reſt of their brethren, or thoſe whom they accounted of no better then of meer naturall and carnall men. For this cauſe their Miniſters would not (as the cuſtome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had been, and was ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by thoſe of the contrary part) privately implore the help and bleſſing of the Almighty upon themſelves and the work which they were forthwith to begin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before their prayers with the people premiſed to their Sermons, but commonly at their firſt entrance into the Pulpit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſignall reverence ſhewn either to God, whom they did repreſent in that place, or to the Auditory whoſe care and burden lay upon their conſcience, or ſenſe of the great difficulty and labour of their employment, ſate them down until the Pſalm was finiſhed: whereby no doubt as well as by other omiſſions of like nature they gave no ſmall occaſion to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98328:27"/>of thinking leſſe honourably both of their perſons and of their calling, then they did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, and opened a wide gap to that irreverence and profaneneſſe which are now every where viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our Church aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>To this inſtance I ſhall adde another of like nature from the uncovering of the head in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at the time of publick devotion, and cuſtome not decent only and reverent in it ſelf even by the light of nature, and well beſeeming the Majeſty of God, but warranted alſo and enjoyned by his word, as appeareth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. verſ. 4. with 7. And how the contrary practiſe of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſiſters may be reconciled with this precept, I am as yet to learn. As for thine own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they even glory in their ſhame, when not as maſters, but as ſcholars; not as teachers, but as Diſciples, they ſit covered at their moſt ſolemn holy meetings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference of place, degree, age, ſeaſon, or of any perſonall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98328:27"/>whatſoever, as if they might ſecurely and lawfully ſlight their ſuperiours in this place, becauſe they give not God his due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour here, or withdraw that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from them in the Church, which they yeeld unto them every where beſides: although we have known ſome, and thoſe not a few, who have preſumed to ſit covered in the preſence of God at ſuch a time as this; but when a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath come into the Aſſembly, have honoured him with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the head, as though civill reſpect towards a mortall Prince, were to be expreſſed by more evident ſigns of ſubmiſſion from the outward man, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip towards the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall God. Surely it may well amaze an indifferent perſon, to conſider that the youth who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtandeth bare in the ſhop, as well in his maſters abſence as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that in token of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſervice, which by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his covenant he oweth to his maſter, ſhould nevertheleſſe ſtand
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98328:28"/>and ſit covered not only in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but alſo in conference with his grand Maſter, or Maſters Maſter which is in heaven? And is not the caſe thus here, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter prayeth or praiſeth God in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> as he frequently doth? At which time every one almoſt is vailed, who notwithſtanding, preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves in this very thing which they allow, foraſmuch as they all uncover the head when the ſame Pſalmes are ſung by them only changed into Meeter, and that perchance for the worſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is not for the better, as if the tone or tune could afford juſt cauſe of this variety and difference in reſpect of outward carriage, and reverence towards God, or the ſame attention of the minde, affection and devotion of the heart, were not due from us to the Lords Word, when the Miniſter readeth it in our ears, as when we our ſelves utter it with our lips; and yet the moſt preciſe ſeem to ſcruple at the one, but ſtartle not at all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98328:28"/>at the other, however the ſame reaſon appeareth for both. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot imagine leſſe, then that this covering of the head in the congregation, where infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſickneſſe doth not plead for it, tendeth to the diſhonour of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe ſervants we profeſſe our ſelves to be, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this time, and to the contempt of his meſſenger repreſenting the Office and Perſon of Chriſt before our eyes; ſurely, this is not <hi>to call the holy of the Lord honourable,</hi> as we finde it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.13.</note> but to make him a reproach.</p>
               <p>A ſixt inſtance we ſhal take from the <hi>Lords day,</hi> by ſome called <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> with a good meaning perchance, but not without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of ſpeech, becauſe not known by this name, either in the primitive times, or in the ages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following, for ought as I can learn; but I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about words. That which is obſervable of the day to our preſent purpoſe, is the different eſteem and obſervation thereof
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98328:29"/>with the two adverſe parties, the one aſcribing too much, the other too little unto the ſame, the one keeping it with almoſt Jewiſh ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and extremity, the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a looſe and formall manner at the beſt; (to omit their unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profanation thereof upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall occaſions) and each walking contrary to other in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe from the ſpirit of oppofition, as well as from other principles. For although it be no eaſie matter to aſſure our ſelves, much leſſe to convince others, that this day is of divine inſtitution, as the ſabbath was among the Jewes, and we ſhould be loth with many to give the ſtrict outward obſervation of the time preheminence above all other morall duties and acts of Religion, (in which reſpect as I remember ſome have thought a ſlender treſpaſſe or offence thereon worthy to be expiated by the death of the offender) yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted again, but that there is a neceſſity of ſeparating or ſetting apart ſuch a day as this,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98328:29"/>for the honour and publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, as well in regard of humane wickedneſſe as weakneſſe; and of their proneneſſe to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Atheiſme, as well as of their worldly buſineſſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; the which they would never intermit of themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſtraint laid upon them, or elſe wholly beſtow the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning time upon the ſervice of their own luſts and ſinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Wherefore they cannot be excuſed, who in times paſt looſed the reins of diſcipline to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yet more (when God knows they were too remiſſe already) and permitted them free liberty to ſpend a part, and that not the leaſt, of this day in vain ſports and paſtimes, ſcarſe beſeeming a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale or marriage feaſt, much leſſe ſuch a ſeaſon as this: of which abuſe, a Divine of the Northern parts ſent thither by the King to preach the Goſpell there, doth greatly, but juſtly complain in an Epiſtle to the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as that which did exceedingly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98328:30"/>hinder the courſes of Religion, and fruſtrate the fruits of their Miniſteriall labours; and withall obſerves, that they who did moſt abet and maintain publick piping and laſcivious dancing on the Lords day, were the open and profeſſed enemies of our Religion. Of ſo bad conſequence are theſe merry ſundaies (as a profane perſon once affectionately called them, ſaying, that it was a good time when they did enjoy the former liberty; but for whom, I cannot tell, except it were for him who is the author of all evill) in which we ſow unto the fleſh, and not unto the Spirit; ſerve our own luſts, and not the Lords will. Wherefore it is needfull that this firſt day of the week be in due manner obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us in all places, eſpecially conſidering that from the Apoſtles time hitherto it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the Church of Chriſt to this holy uſe.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh inſtance we ſhal borrow from the <hi>Lords Proyer,</hi> the which we muſt acknowledge for the true
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98328:30"/>and perpetuall pattern of our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications unto the worlds end. And yet how much hath it been of late decryed and vilified by ſome not as needleſſe only, but as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo? Who have therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the uſe thereof in publick Aſſemblies, and derided thoſe who took pleaſure therein, and others have layed it aſide for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing the powerfull party, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſtill approve it in their judgement, and have done by their practiſe heretofore. Many pretend for the diſuſe thereof, that the people did idolize it, and impute a kinde of holineſſe to the bare ſaying or repeating of the ſame: the which, ſuppoſing it to be true, can in no wiſe warrant their omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this form, if it be good, much leſſe their preaching or ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt it; for if we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn every thing as bad in it ſelf, or noxious to us, becauſe it may or doth occaſionally prove ſo through our perverſe uſe or abuſe thereof, what can eſcape our cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, be the thing never ſo good?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98328:31"/>yea ſhall we not then very often <hi>call evill good,
<note place="margin">Iſai, 5.20.</note> and good evill, put dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe, bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter?</hi> The patience of God we know is abuſed daily, and his grace turned into wantonneſſe by wicked and ungodly perſons, and yet it were the height of impiety to think the worſe of either for this reaſon, the fault ſolely reſting upon man. In like manner <hi>every creature of God,</hi> which (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4.) <hi>is good,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.4.</note> and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thanksgiving,</hi> is made <hi>ſubject to our vanity and corruption,</hi> and become the idoll of our pleaſurable, or of our profitable luſts. How much better were it therefore for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in this caſe to ſhew the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their errour or failing in the uſe of that wich is good, then to poſſeſſe them with a falſe opinion and wrong conceit of the thing it ſelf as evill, and to be avoided of them, the which they uſe not dexterouſly, and as they ſhould. But ſuch is, and ever will be the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98328:31"/>force of faction and ſchiſme in the heart; of men to make them oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one to another in judgement and in practiſe, without and againſt all reaſon whatſoever. The which alſo we may further diſcover in the length and brevity of their prayers, in the manner and matter of their praying, in the affected difference of tone and voice, of words or formes of expreſſion, of geſture and behaviour in the acts of ſolemn worſhip, and ſuch like, with eaſie obſervation.</p>
               <p>And ſo far hath their malice proceeded one againſt another, that neither of them would by any means admit ſo much as praying for the adverſe party, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded by the precepts of the Goſpell, but openly curſed each the other as deſperate enemies of God and of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall crave leave to addreſſe my words unto thy ſons, according to their ſeverall orders and degrees, entreating them all to bear with the rude plainneſſe of my counſell, and not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98328:32"/>at the liberty of my reproof, being free from malice and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, from partiality, from guile and hypocriſie. And firſt I ſhall direct my ſpeech to thoſe who were the chief Rulers of thy people, and acknowledged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the ſame unto this preſent day. The time was when no man durſt mutter againſt you, much leſſe reprove you openly for what you did amiſſe, the height of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the intimacy of grace and favour ye had with the Prince and (that which doth for the moſt part ever accompany ſo great felicity) an anſwerable opinion of your own vertue and worth, would by no means admit of this boldneſſe and preſumption in inferiour perſons, how well meaning ſoever, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ſervice of your power and place in the Church of Chriſt. As for others, there was cauſe enough perchance, why ye might except againſt their reproof, as proceeding from pride, faction, hatred, or contempt of your perſons, and government; tending to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98328:32"/>of your authority &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, or directly intended to defame and make odious both your ſelves and adminiſtration with the people. And as it was no ſmall crime in theſe men to kick againſt your authority, when it was at the higheſt pitch: ſo it would be no leſſe, if not greater in any to ſpurn at it now, when it is at the loweſt ebbe, much more to trample upon it lying as it were in the duſt. For what could ſavour more of inhumanity and cruelty, then thus to deal with a profeſſed enemy? Wherefore, far be it from me to inſult upon your faln dignity, or to uſe this freedome towards you with any private ſiniſter reſpect unto my ſelf. All that I aim at, God knoweth, is this, with filiall reverence and love to admoniſh you of what you ſeemed formerly to be ignorant, at leaſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant according to your Fatherly duty, and for which we ought now to be humbled, that God may be glorified. And indeed how happy had it been for your ſelves,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98328:33"/>and likewiſe for the flock of Chriſt committed to your charge, if ye had in times paſt duly laid theſe things to heart, which I ſhall at this preſent offer to your view, not from any confidence of reaſon and knowledge in my ſelf, more then in you, or in any meaſure equall unto that which remaineth with you, but from an aſſurance that ye were then blinded with worldly intereſt, and therefore could not ſo clearly ſee, as was needfull, your many failings: or may at this day, ſince the hand of the Lord hath been very heavie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to chaſten and try you, and (as we hope) not only for your own private inſtruction and benefit, but for the common good of his whole Church and people alſo in time to come, who wait with patience upon him who hath promiſed that <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to them that love him,</hi> to them that <hi>are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> And now with what depth of ſorrow ought we to recount your paſt errors, partly through
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98328:33"/>neglect of duty, partly through abuſe of power? God the wiſe diſpoſer of all things in the world, was pleaſed to ſet you as ſo many greater Luminaries in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church, there to ſhine forth by the raies of pure Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall doctrine, and by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious example of holineſſe for the illumination and direction of his people; you he appointed as grand Inſtructors and Teachers in the Schoole of Chriſt Jeſus to inform his Diſciples concerning his Law and will, to reform them (when need did ſo require) by the rod of his diſcipline. But were ye faithfull in your truſt? did ye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently inſtruct the ignorant? ſeverely puniſh the diſobedient? endevour to reclaim thoſe who walked diſorderly, and contrary to the Goſpell? Did ye reprove all indifferently? cenſure all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially? not reſpecting or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the perſons, but the crimes of men delinquent? That ye were violently bent againſt faction and ſchiſme, againſt ſingularity and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98328:34"/>non-conformity; all confeſſe, a few excepted, who thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much, yea nothing enough in this kinde, how oppoſite ſoever to Chriſtian mildeneſſe, prudence or conſcience: But in the mean while by reaſon of your connivence, or ſupineneſſe in the Epiſcopall office, ignorance, and ſuperſtition, every where miſled the people; and cauſed them to wander in darkneſſe, not knowing whither they went: Profaneneſſe like a rank pernicious weed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the field, and vineyard of the Lord; and as it fares with plants of different nature and quality growing in the ſame ſoile, which oftentimes thrive the better one for another, becauſe the one ſucketh that moiſture and nouriſhment from the earth, which are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for, or perchance deſtructive to the other: ſo it came to paſſe here; for the profane and vicious lives of thoſe who ſtood up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of your government, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally gave encreaſe and added ſtrength to the oppoſite factious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98328:34"/>who alleadged this as one main ground of their ſeparation from the church, that thoſe who adhered to it were for the moſt part unworthy to have communion with any orderly well governed Congregation of Believers, becauſe of their looſe and ſcandalous manner of living, the which for that they could not redreſſe, they did pretend at leaſt they were bound thus to ſhun and avoid, as hatefull to God and to good men. Wherefore ye did not carefully ſeparate between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the vile, but conſulting with fleſh &amp; bloud what ye were to doe in this caſe, thought in humane policy, to break the power of one party, by ſtrengthening the hands of the other, or not binding and reſtraining them with the cords of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. Thus while you oppoſed profaneneſſe againſt ſchiſm, or did let that looſe at this, or ſecretly favoured and upheld it in hope to ſuppreſſe the later by the former; the one grew too ſtrong by the violence of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for your ſelves, and both
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98328:35"/>for the Church in order to peace and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>As for your labour in the work of the Miniſtry, how little it hath been for many years together, it is even a ſhame to mention, ſome of you wholly exempting themſelves from this neceſſary burthen of their calling for eaſe and pleaſure, others ſuppoſing it a task and imployment too low and inferiour for them, as men intirely addicted to the government of the Church, and of another ſphear farre above the labouring Miniſter; the reſt for the moſt part ſlightly or ſeldome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it with their ſhoulders, and laying it aſide preſently, as that which concerned other men, and not themſelves any longer then they liſted, or their ſuperours impoſed the ſame upon them. And thus far it had been, or perchance might have been pardonable with men, had care been taken by you to ſee this work duly performed of the Clergy in your ſeverall Dioceſes, and Cities of Reſidence, or to provide able and ſit Paſtors
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98328:35"/>for the people throughout your particular Congregations, or paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall charges within the limits of your juriſdiction. But alas! there were not wanting of you, who did not onely wink at the wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their inferiour brethren in this main point of Miniſterial duty, but did countenance and ſavour ſuch as were moſt peccant therein, judging them moſt averſe from faction, who were leaſt conſcious of preaching to the people, and fuireſt friends to the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who were looſe enough (God knoweth) in reſpect both of their office and alſo of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: whence it came to paſſe, that very many who profeſſed themſelves for you in the time of triall, were ignorant and diſſolute men, diſhonourable to your party, and Indeed to Chriſtian Religion, the which they did continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane by their words and works: ſo unſuteable is humane policy with Evangelicall ſimplicity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſſefull when it is uſed at any time to ſupport and uphold the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98328:36"/>regiment thereof. And in ſtead of ſending forth meet <hi>Labourers into the Lords harveſt,</hi> fit Paſtors into his flock, you diſmiſſed thoſe who were <hi>idle ſhepheards,</hi> loving to ſlumber, given to ſleep, altogether like your ſelves, careleſſe of the Lords heritage, either unwilling if able, or if willing unable, or neither willing nor able, rightly to divide the Word of Truth, giving them their portion in due ſeaſon. As for thoſe to whom God had given both ability and will to preach the Word, ye permitted them not the free uſe and exerciſe of their gifts: but forbade them to teach the people as often as they ſaw it convenient or neceſſary for their edification; and though yee did at firſt commend unto them the way of catechiſing the younger ſort, as beſt beſeeming their want of yeares and experience in the word of righteouſneſſe, allowing them ſome liberty &amp; latitude here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: yet afterward (I know not upon what grounds, or for what reaſon) ye ſo far limited and reſtrained the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98328:36"/>Miniſter in this pious and profitable practiſe, that ye did in a manner take away the <hi>key of Knowledg</hi> from the people,

               <p>And herein remarkable is the judgement of the Almighty towards you, in that he hath made ſome of thoſe unworthy members inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to your downfall, whom contrary to reaſon and conſcience yee authoriſed for a work to which God never called them, promoted to that honour, of which they were uncapable, either for your own gain, or to gratifie your Officers and domeſtick ſervants, or your friends and favorites, or for other ends as bad as theſe, beſt known unto your ſelves; For who have more raiſed and maintained a party againſt you, then ſuch as theſe? or have been more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the ring-leaders of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then they? or more diligently ſcattered abroad the ſeeds of ſchiſm, and oppoſition againſt government in the Church of Chriſt, of which they have ſeen plentifull increaſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98328:37"/>and have found ſucceſſe of this their labour, if not above their deſire, yet ſurely beyond their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding it be hard to ſay whether their indigency of parts, or want of ſubſiſtence was the greater, which no doubt at firſt made them ſo plyable as they were to popular will and humor.</p>
               <p>But ye will reply, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church were not ſtrict or ſtraight enough to debar unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons, eſpecially in point of learning, from the Office of the Miniſtry; beſides that you admitted none unto the work, but thoſe who were commended unto you for their ſufficiency and ability, in all reſpects, for this ſervice by letters Teſtimoniall from the Univerſity, or from Miniſters well reputed and reported of in the Dioceſe from whence they came, or where they lived, in former time. But who knew not, (and your ſelves more then any) how invalid and weake this teſtimony was, being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a meer formality, by the cuſtom and manners of the times, as

They pretend the power of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to be diſtinct and ſeparate from that of the Biſhop in many points of ſpirituall juriſdiction, and therefore exempt from it, or uncontroulable by it, however proving illegall and exorbitant in the proceedings thereof: whether uſe and cuſtome had thus determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the matter or no, I am as yet to ſeek; but this I take for certain Truth, that the Chancellors power at the firſt was in every

But Court-employment, State-flattery &amp; ſinful complyances with great Perſons, were the main lets, which hindred you from the due diſcharge of your Office both in Preaching the Word, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the the Rod of Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his minde and will, while ye thought in carnall reaſon ſuch

Wherefore it is no wonder if vice did reign there, where flattery did abound, and that in the chiefe Miniſters and meſſengers of Truth, if injuſtice and oppreſſion did bear ſway, where one and al were taught not what they ſhould and ought to doe according to their duty and conſcience towards God, but what they could or might doe by power without controule from man; If men were ſecure in their ſins, where peace was proclaimed, and war to be denounced againſt them; where a profane compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heard nothing for the moſt part decryed in the Pulpit, but faction, from which perchance they were alone free. And what could be expected from the common people but blinde ignorance, love of pleaſures more then of God, greater regard of this world, then of the world to come, when ye
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98328:40"/>their chief Leaders cauſed them to erre, not onely through your negligence, but alſo by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, falling farre ſhort of that integrity and holineſſe, which was conſpicuous in the actions and ſufferings of thoſe, who were not long before you reſident in the ſame places of dignity and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence. For although they lived upon earth, they had their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven, and ſhone as the ſtars of heaven for brightneſſe, not onely in their life, but in their death alſo, which was precious in the ſight of their Redeemer. As for you their ſucceſſours, ye appeared in compariſon of them but dim and earthy lights; and I would to God ſome of you had not proved falſe likewiſe and deceitfull to your brethren, whom ye perverted from the way of Truth and Peace by your own departing from it, doing quite contrary to what your ſelves taught and profeſſed before the people, preaching contempt and hatred of the world to others, your ſelves continuing in the mean while faſt

               <p>I have but a word more to ſpeak unto you, and I ſhall conclude. It is concerning <hi>your lives:</hi> The which I would to God were not ſo well obſerved and known of the people to your prejudice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, as generally they are throughout the whole land; for then ſhould I with reverence to your calling, gladly paſſe by your failings in ſilence: But the dimneſſe of <hi>light</hi> cannot be <hi>concealed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.14.</note> and a <hi>city that is ſet on an hill cannot be hid.</hi> Ye every where complain, and not without cauſe, that ſcorn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach are caſt upon you by the baſeſt of the people, that men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98328:50"/>your right from you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law and conſcience. But conſider with your ſelves whether ye have not exceſſively deſerved this uſage from them at the hands of God. For what do they yet ſee, or have ſeen heretofore in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you worthy of imitation or honour? Have ye lived after the pattern of your own doctrine, and not rather deſtroyed by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, what ye built up by your teaching? For ye who preached holy contempt of the world unto others, were your ſelves lovers of the world ye who exhorted others to ſelf-deniall, and obedience of the Goſpell, did your ſelves lead lives unbeſeeming the Goſpell of Chriſt Jeſus; ye that were above others in reſpect of your office and place in the Church of God, did oſt times live beneath the meaneſt of them, who were committed to your charge, being infamous for your pride of liſe, lightneſſe and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of behaviour, exceſſe of wine and ſtrong drink, and for other crimes diſhonourable in the life
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98328:51"/>of the meaneſt perſon profeſſing the Goſpell, much more in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of a Paſtour. Now what in all probability could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from theſe courſes, but that the people would at length enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a low opinion of your ſelves and calling, yea, and of Religion it ſelf? as we ſee it come to paſſe this day. Foraſmuch as they live after your example, and make no account of your precept, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well grounded on the word of truth, or powerfully laid home to their conſcience by the paſſion and eloquence of the ſpeaker: ſo little regard have men for the moſt part to the words of their ſpiritual leaders, and ſo much to their works, eſpecially, when agreeing with that carnall diſpoſition or corruption, which is predominant in the mindes of the major and worſt ſort of the world.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98328:52"/>theſe, nor a way laid open for Libertiniſme to them.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98328:54"/>eminent in the body politick, and far above the other members, as in dignity of place, ſo likewiſe of deſert: But alas, with grief and ſhame I mention it, many, that I may not ſay the moſt part of you, have not been ſo high above them in reſpect of your birth, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall honour annexed thereunto, as ye have been beneath them for reall inward worth of goodneſſe and vertue, by which alone ye can approve your ſelves unto God, and become truly honourable in the judgement of men. Ye may happily much pride your ſelves in the antiquity and ſplendor of your families heretofore, in the valour and exploits of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors: but do theſe tend to your glory, and not rather to your infamy and reproach, who have ſo far degenerated from your anceſters, that ye retain nothing of them now, but their name with the outward badges or enſigns of their gentility; beſides the ſins and vices of their perſons, which partly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, partly profit, and partly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98328:55"/>have made as hereditary to your houſes, as the lands which ye do poſſeſſe. And are not theſe ſo many ſpots of your nobility, as well as of your Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I mean your ſacriledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of religion and of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, open profaneneſſe, and ſcoffing both at the ſimplicity of godlineſſe, and at the iniquity of ſin, ſwearing, pride of life, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, exceſſe of riot, unſatiate luſt, oppreſſion of your olients, boundleſſe covetouſneſſe, with others of the like nature, the which I ſhall not ſtir at this time. For how many ſervants and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Lord, have with their whole families been reduced by your means to worſe extremities then I am willing to expreſſe, and could obtain no relief from you, without baſe flattery, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full compliance with your lewd and ſinfull courſes of life? a thing every way diſhonourable to the calling of a Miniſter, ſo near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching unto God himſelf as this doth. In the mean while
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98328:55"/>what uſe ye made of the Lords portion forced from the right owner thereof, is ſufficiently known to the world. For did ye not like thoſe <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4,
<note place="margin">Amos 6.4.</note> &amp;c. <hi>lie upon beds of Ivory,</hi> or of ſuch choice and precious matter as this, <hi>and ſtretch your ſelves upon your couches</hi> (or abound with ſuperfluities) <hi>and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midſt of the ſtall? Did ye not chant to the ſound of the violl, drink wine out of bouls, and were not at all grieved for the afflictions of</hi> Joſeph? And all this ſometimes, of the moſt part upon the Churches patrimony? Beſides this, which is as bad, yea much worſe; how many poor ſouls, by this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of good from the owners thereof, have periſhed in the land through <hi>famine</hi> and <hi>thirſt,</hi> not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of <hi>hearing the words of the Lord,</hi> which have been either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deſtitute of a teaching prieſt, or committed to the charge of one as ignorant as themſelves, to ſave your purſes though with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98328:56"/>the loſſe of their moſt precious ſouls, the guilt of which will one day lie more heavie upon your conſcience, then thought is now able to conceive, much leſſe tongue to expreſſe. And although the large and ample revenue; that ſome of you enjoyed over and above the lot of Chriſt, might well have prompted to you a better minde towards his worſhip and the Miniſters thereof: yet neither this conſideration, nor the improſperity of your families, with thoſe ſtrange remarkable judgements obſerved by many from the Almighty upon your houſes, have been in the leaſt meaſure prevalent with you for repentance and reſtitution of what ye have thus gotten or detained from his Church unto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day. Neither will preſcription or time bear you out in this matter: for <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regum Regi;</hi> and if the King had this prerogative in times paſt, much more doth it belong to God for ever.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98328:56"/>
               <p>As for your profaneneſſe and contempt of Divine Worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the apparent and notorious wickedneſſe of your lives, your coniving at ſin, in places of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and publique Truſt, or indeed (ſecret at leaſt) maintaining and incouraging thereof in the more looſe and vicious ſort of people, at the beſt, but weak and faint oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made by you againſt it, (And in truth with what face could ye puniſh or controule thoſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in other men, whereof your ſelves were more guilty then they in your own conſcience?) Beſides theſe I ſay, let your irreverent and irreligious carriage in the Church of God at the time of ſolemn ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on his day atteſt the truth of this charge, the which generally was far more vain and light, then did become Saints at any time, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the more immediate preſence of the moſt holy, and indeed then that, which your ſelves would expect from your ſervants, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriours in your private houſes, or can with patience endure from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98328:57"/>them. For what whiſpering, ſmiling, want on paſſages of geſture, diſcourſe, and other not ſit to be named, did fill up the meaſure of that houre (and of your owne iniquity) which the Miniſter did beſtow on praying and preaching of the Word? whereas if ye at any time came into the Congregation, your poore Tenants muſt intermit their devotions, and ſtand up to honour you, though with the diſhonour of their Maker: a reſpect not to be required of any at ſuch a time as this, no nor to be received from any if offered, or admitted by any perſon how great ſoever, becauſe diſpleaſing unto him, who is a God jealous of his honor, and will not give his glory to another. Now had it not been much better for you in reſpect of your owne ſoules, the which ye did ſo foully ſtain by this ungodly behaviour, and of the ſoules of your brethren, whom ye did offend and grieve, or corrupt by your lewd example, and leſſe hatefull to the Lord, not to have been preſent at all at his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98328:57"/>Ordinances, then thus groſſely to profane them? But this impious preſumption and over daring boldneſſe of ſinning and provoking your Redeemer to his Face, ye took to be the priviledge of your birth and place, and therefore other men were more cautious and ſparing herein then your ſelves, or made more conſcience then you, of what they did at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place as this is.</p>
               <p>It may ſeeme incredible what I have been informed of a Peere of the Realm, and yet I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt the truth thereof, both for the Relatours ſake, and for the relation which is common in and about that place where he lately lived. Hee uſed every Lords Day, when he went with his Family to the Church, to have his Maſtive goe before him, with a Marmoſet, or ſome ſuch creature near of kin to this, upon the Dogs back; a ſtrange Pageant for ſuch a ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what his end and aim at was in this I ſhall forbear to cenſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>Now touching your unneceſſary, raſh, frequent and many times falſe ſwearing, by the terrible and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full name of the great God of Heaven and Earth, and by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Son Jeſus Chriſt, equall to himſelf in Majeſty and Power (whoſe bloud and wounds, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, parts and properties were ſeldome or never mentioned by you, but in this ſinfull way of profanation) and your uſuall imprecations of his wrath upon your ſoules, where no juſt occaſion I am ſure, if any at all, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of ſo deep aſſeverations and proteſtations againſt your ſelves before the faithfull witneſſe, and impartiall Judge of all hearts: what can we ſay of it, but that it was the Gentlemans ordinary Rhetorick, the common grace of his ſpeech, and the ſuppoſed Ornament of his diſcourſe; Oathes being with him <hi>pigmenta orationis,</hi> wherein he did much glory, and whereof he did make ſpeciall uſe (though bad
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98328:58"/>enough God knoweth) when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſpute, or elocution did fail him, although he might well conſider how <hi>that which is highly eſteemed among men, is abomination in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 15.16.</note> And oh the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious influence of evill example, from ſuperiours upon the inferior ſort! how generall hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion been in the land? how far hath this canker overſpread the body of this Nation? Derived (as we have juſt cauſe to imagine) from you as from the fountain, and ſo by your dependants and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as by ſo many corrupt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, conveyed to the reſt of the people. Inſomuch as many at this time, account no more of this needleſs, but great tranſgreſſion of the Divine Law, then they doe of any idle word, which proceedeth out of their mouths without thought or premeditation of what they were to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhould take occaſion next to reprove you for your pride; I mean that which doth manifeſt it ſelf to the world by outward
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98328:59"/>garb and faſhion of the times: but that I have juſt cauſe to beleeve, at leaſt am willing to hope of many of you, that the grievous and ſad calamities, which by the juſt hand of God have fallen upon your eſtates and families in theſe dyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous times of war, have in ſome meaſure humbled and abaſed your ſpirits, and taken off from the vanity and lightneſſe both of your behaviour and apparell: ſo much <hi>is ſorrow better then laughter,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.3.</note> for by the ſadneſſe of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi> And yet alas, not a few of your degree even to this day, are ſo far from being truely ſenſible of their ſufferings, that they ſeem to be more hardned in their pride at this preſent then before, and waxe more wanton againſt the Lord, ſince his hand hath been upon them for triall and correction, then in former times, like thoſe of whom we read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.9, 10. The Lord pardon and reclaim them from the error of their wayes.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall proceed to ſpeak
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98328:59"/>of your <hi>Epicurean</hi> or voluptuous manner of living, together with your riot and exceſſe, becauſe of their near affinity. Firſt then, if nothing elſe could be laid to your charge, then a continuall proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of enterchangeable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or endevour without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to gratifie ſinful concupiſcence with whatſoever it deſireth, or luſteth after, were not this enough to condemn you before the juſt tribunall of your Maker? For did he who came to redeem you ever lead ſuch a life as this upon the earth? or commend it to his Diſciples and followers? no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For mourning, mortification, ſelf-denyall, taking up, and bearing the croſſe, or patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of reproaches and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (ever attending on the ſincere and zealous profeſſion of the Goſpell) tender compaſſion toward our brethren in miſery, with preſent relief of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities according to our power and ability. In a word, contempt of this preſent world, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98328:60"/>from the enticing pleaſures thereof, are the ſubject matter of all his Sermons, the pith of his Doctrine, the marrow of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And doe ye ſtill think that a paradiſe of earthly pleaſures is the way to an heavenly paradiſe of comfort and delight? or that an heaven of carnall happineſſe here may in likelyhood be a paſſage unto an heaven of ſpirituall and eternall felicity hereafter? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old could not arrive to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but by the long and dangerous way through the Wilderneſſe; and the Goſpell which doth promiſe us a <hi>Kingdome</hi> in the world to come, doth withall aſſure us,
<note place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> that <hi>wee muſt through much tribulation enter in to the Kingdome of God.</hi> And ye hope, or rather dream of a <hi>Canaan</hi> in the way, and another at the journeys end; ye would fain wear the Crown, and yet not bear the Croſſe; obtain the victory, and never enter into the battail, rejoice in the triumph, and not ſweat in the fight. But oh conſider I pray
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98328:60"/>you, and lay to heart that curſe of your confidence
<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 16.25.</note>, and what hath often founded in your eares, but never as yet entred into your hearts, ye eſpecially who every day glut your ſelves with the choiceſt dainties which the Sea or land can afford, feeding your ſelves without fear,

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98328:61"/>Lord hath already brought to paſſe what he hath threatned to doe in many of your habitations, where we may finde no ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of that luxuriant plenty and aboundance which ye formerly had, but abuſed to the diſhonour of him who gave it, partly through your riot and exceſſe, whereby ye have viciouſly and ſhamefully wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thoſe godly eſtates, which the induſtrious care and travail of your forefathers tranſmitted unto you their unworthy progenie, and ſometimes purchaſed for themſelves and you at much a dearer rate, even with the deſperate adventure and hazard of their precious lives, or through the iniquity of the preſent times, whereby God hath already in a very great meaſure ſcourged you for the ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe, the which he ſaw in you, and will yet puniſh you more even to utter extirpation, if ye doe not timely meet him in the way of his judgements, and make your peace with him, by the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement of your ſins
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98328:61"/>and ſpeedy turning from them unto him, who ſmiteth you for this cauſe, that ye may repent and be healed.</p>
               <p>To this wee may adde, your wantonneſſe or unlawfull luſt, the true and proper daughter of riot and exceſſe. In which how far ye have tranſgreſſed within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a few years paſt, let your owne actions and behaviour viſible enough God knoweth, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in this particular witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, beſides the teſtimony of your own conſcience; Are not your meetings at the Park and Garden by the great City knowne to all the world? To omit your mixed and looſe Dancings, Table-communications, Cup-diſcourſe, and ſuch like, what meaneth I pray you the effeminate delicacy, attire and garb of the maſculine ſex? The faſhion, dreſſe, gate, painting and patches of the Female? Doth not the ſhew of their countenance teſtifie againſt them? although the men alſo have of late been ſo vain as to borrow this uncivill faſhion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98328:62"/>from the women, I mean the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of patches on their faces, which are indeed but ſo many blemiſhes to the reputation of both, and markes of diſhoneſty, not (as they take them to be) garniſhing ſpots of comelineſſe and beauty. And yet with how great care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence are ſome of theſe procured for you? I am aſhamed to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what hath hath been reported to me for a certainty concerning this thing. Oh ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of luxury to thoſe who are gone before us! how many empty howels might charity refreſh, how many naked bodies clothe with this waſte and altogether needleſſe coſt? As for your Ladies former Ball-conventicles, wherewith they have been publiquely upbraided on the Theatre, and your famed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in ſecret with the laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Courts, for liberty and allowance in luſt, with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable banquettings, and novel irritations invented or uſed by you for this unclean purpoſe, let them never be remembred any more, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98328:62"/>made known to thoſe who ſhall come after; neither liſt I to ſtir any farther in this puddle or ſink of corruption. I ſhall not ſpeak much of your oppreſſing and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your poor Tenants, occaſioned, no doubt, many times as well by your luxury and coſtly manner of living, as by your covetouſneſſe and immoderate deſire of enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your poſſeſſions: Foraſmuch as that doth often caſt you upon thoſe neceſſities which ye cannot relieve but by this unjuſt way whereunto ye have compelled your ſelves by your foregoing ſin. Now as ye have by this means generally loſt the good opinion and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, (according to late and ſorrowfull experience thereof towards your perſons and proceedings) ſo have ye highly provoked the wrath of God againſt your ſelves and families, and as much, if not more, by your unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate covetouſneſſe; whereby many of you indeed (and who not in deſire?) <hi>join houſe to houſe,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 5.8.</note> lay field to field, till there be no place, that ye
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98328:63"/>may be planted alone in the midſt of the earth:</hi> Not fearing nor minding the curſe of the Almighty, which he hath denounced againſt you in the next v. by the Prophet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it hath already entred into many of your habitations, for <hi>of a truth, even to this day many houſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and though great and fair, without inhabitant.</hi> But to what purpoſe is all this care and much adoe? Surely, to make your families great &amp; mighty upon the earth, to leave your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vaſt inheritances of land, and treaſure which knows no bottome. But oh that ye could have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect now in your life of two or three generations to come, would you not then condemn your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent folly, and perceive a great deal of improvidence in this your provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſolicitous care for them? for then might you ſee according to the common courſe of the world, one deſcended from you prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſpending that ſubſtance which your diligence and paines thriftily got for him; another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately running himſelf out of

               </p>
               <p>I have but one word of reproof more, and I am ſure it will be unexpected of you, the Lord grant that it be not unwelcome alſo; It is concerning your Domeſtick Chaplaines, whom partly your own pride, partly the evill cuſtome of the Times hath taught you to entertain in no better faſhion, then as honorary ſervants in your houſes; whereby the worthy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Miniſtry is much deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dignity thereof, and no ſmall contempt drawn upon it from the vulgar ſort of people, eſpecially thoſe that depend upon your greatneſſe, which are very many. For this is far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, or the Meſſenger of Chriſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98328:64"/>with that honour which is due to Chriſt, to place him in the rank of thoſe who continually expect your commands, and are at your devotion. Beſides this, it is a great ſhame, that men of ingenuous education, ſometimes not inferior to your ſelves in birth, and ſcarce ever not above you in reſpect of intellectuall parts, and indowments of the ſoul, ſhould nevertheleſſe be conſtrained to ſtand as ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at your tables, or to ſit in the meaneſt place belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſcarſe daring to peep or mutter without a brow-check or controul from their faſtidious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons; and all this to ſerve your ſtate, to which alſo their praying, preaching, and other acts of their Miniſteriall Office muſt ſubmit both for the maner, extent, and other circumſtances pertaining to the action, or elſe there is no long abode for them with you. To omit the many ſcoffes, verball and reall indignities they are fain oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to put up with patience not onely at the hands of children,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98328:65"/>but of ſervants alſo for quietneſſe ſake, if not rather for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity, unleſſe they purchaſe reſpect from them with a good part of that ſtipend, which they receive from you. Inſomuch as one not unaptly (as the caſe ſtands now) termed a Chaplain in a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemans houſe, a black ſerving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Wherefore God hath juſtly given you up unto contempt and reproach, ſo that the vileſt of men are become Lords over you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have thought light of his Worſhip, and the Miniſters thereof, and have made both it and them contemptible in the ſight of others by your example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humble your ſelves</hi> therefore <hi>under the mighty hand of God,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.6.</note> that hee may exalt you in due time.
<note place="margin">Jac. 4.9.</note> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep,</hi> for the ſins of your Fathers the which ye doe inherit as well as their lands, for your own perſonall ſins which are great and many, for the ſins of your families, for the ſins of the people, which they have been bold to commit through your conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98328:65"/>or after your pattern, for all, but chiefly and above all for your glorying in ſin, which is your ſhame, and the reproach of your Maker, the height of impiety and deepeſt ſtain of ſinfull guilt. And learn henceforth to honour that Religion which ye have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deſpiſed, to be zealous for the truth of God, to reverence and ſupport the Miniſtry of Chriſt, to <hi>call the Sabbath a delight,
<note place="margin">Iſa 58.13, 14.</note> the holy of the Lord honourable, that ye may delight your ſelves in the Lord, and he may cauſe you to ride upon the high places of the earth;</hi> To countenance and encourage all that live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpell, and not prefer vain and ſcurrilous perſons before them. Eſteeme not of men (as your cuſtome is) more by their outward garb and apparell, then by their inward worth, but reſpect them in the firſt place for this, and ſhew it by your carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. There is a ſort of men in the world, who for pride, or upon pretence of noble birth; though of decayed families, or in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98328:66"/>a remote diſtance from thoſe that are flouriſhing, follow your mode and faſhion, the which are the moſt fooliſh, diſhoneſt, and many times the pooreſt as well in purſe as in conditions, that are in the Nation; doe not favour or uphold them in their courſes, leſt they prove miſchievous to your ſelves and others.

For how many of you thought an Univerſity life to conſiſt in vacancy from all employment, even that of the minde as well as that of the body, and in the pleaſure of recreation and ſport, to ſay no worſe, abſtracted from ſtudy and contemplation? I am aſhamed to mention, and would to God it were in my power to conceal the ſloth and Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme of others, who divided their whole life to thoſe naturall actions of eating, drinking, and ſleeping, <hi>as naturall brute beaſts made to be taken and deſtroyed:

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98328:69"/>of their fellow Members, as if it had been a ſin, at leaſt a ſhame to be ſtudious, arrogating in the mean while to themſelves (that of which God knowes they were not guilty) eminency of parts above their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent brethren, for which they would be beholding to nature only, and to their ſottiſh company. But enough and too much of theſe.</p>
               <p>As for faction, how cloſely did it lurk every where in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges? And yet how openly did it declare and publiſh it ſelf in the Univerſity?

                  </gap>ing the poſitions and tenents one of another; and in the Schools fiercely bandying each againſt his adverſary, and all ſtriving for maſtery, not for truth. In the mean while what libellous defamations were ſecretly compoſed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly ſpread abroad, ſometimes by this, and other whiles by that party,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98328:70"/>tending to the infamy and diſgrace both of the cauſe and of the perſons that maintained the ſame. As for the <hi>Arminian</hi> faction, it was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upheld and encouraged by the ſuperiour power, though under pretence of ſilencing both, as it did appear by an injunction from ſupreme Authority inhibiting theſe diſputes and contentions which had ſo much diſquieted the peace of this grand ſeminary of the Church. But the partiality that was ever ſhewn towards them which did tranſgreſſe on the higher ground, the countenance and favour with preferment caſt upon them by thoſe who ſate at the ſtern, together with the rigour and ſeverity uſed in cenſuring the oppoſite delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent party, gave ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the world what their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, who impoſed ceſſation and ſilence upon the pens and tongues of theſe eager and bitter adverſaries. For notwithſtanding this ſpecious prohibition, that party which did moſt pretend to obedience, did ſay and do as before,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98328:70"/>without check or controll from their ſuperiours; knowing full well what their minde was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing, and finding by experience oft-times, that it did ſmooth a by-way for them to the end of their ambitious deſires. And here it ſeemeth ſtrange to me, that they who did recede from their former principles &amp; grounds of doctrine to joyn with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> faction, became for the moſt part more looſe in their life, and diſſolute in their manners then before; confuting and deſtroying their newly received opinion of free will by the licentious courſes of their converſation, which they did aſſert by argument and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of reaſon againſt them which did oppoſe the ſame, like men deſtitute of that grace, the which they endeavoured to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the force and operation thereof upon the ſoul of a ſinner. And ſome we have known in times paſt moſt zealous advocates for the <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine, ſince quite fallen away from the reformed Church
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98328:71"/>to the ſuperſtition and idolatry of <hi>Rome,</hi> being perchance the more eaſily induced thereunto by the progreſſe which they had made in the way before: the cauſes and motives whereof, one at leaſt hath divulged to the world for the juſtifying of his Apoſtaſie; as for his intentions, theſe are known to God only and to his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to whom we leave him. For it was a wonder to hear what virulent ſpeeches were uttered by men of this ſtamp, againſt the firſt reformers of the Church: <hi>Perfecto odio odi Calvinum,</hi> was reported to be the expreſſion of one famed for other parts as well as for thoſe of learning among you. But I had rather omit then recite: paſſages of this nature for divers reaſons, not to be mentioned at this preſent time.</p>
               <p>As for the other faction, their late proceedings have given in ſufficient evidence againſt them of their treachery and falſhood, and repreſented a full, but foul cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their perſons to all wiſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98328:71"/>and diſcerning men, however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny through ignorance, or affection, or ſelf-intereſt entertain an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conceit of their way and actions unto this day. And now we ſhall proceed to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your perjury, an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall ſurely (if any other) ſin, which though an offence of high nature before God, was common with the major part of your ſociety, that I may not ſay generally ſlighted by all becauſe of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and cuſtomary practiſe of men herein. For it was very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and indeed a matter of courſe with them to atteſt upon oath the ſufficiency or ability of any perſon to receive a graduall promotion in the Univerſity, how illiterate and otherwiſe unworthy ſoever he was of that favour. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcio</hi> was tendred and accepted in his behalf where a <hi>credo</hi> had been too much, a <hi>neſcio</hi> was due, or in truth a <hi>nego</hi> rather. And what a congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote for the ſame purpoſe was, I need not to explain. Surely, ſuch men had either a very low eſteem
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98328:72"/>of the religious tye of any oath, or ſcarce thought theſe of their corporation obligatory in point of conſcience, but rather ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of meer formality or cuſtome. Although I have often heard it reported of a very learned and pious Biſhop now with the Lord, that in his confeſſions to God he uſually craved pardon of him for his Univerſity oathes, the which probably he had readily taken, but ſlackly performed as well as the reſt of his brethren.</p>
               <p>Neither did this ſin reign in publick only, but alſo in private ſocieties, as your corrupt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did evidently ſhew. In which the fear or favour of great perſons in hope to riſe by them, eſpecially of one who could do all in his time, reſpect of birth, or love of money, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I liſt not now to name; were more prevalent with you, then conſcience of oath or duty. Deſert being for the moſt part laid aſide by you, and learning not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when it did enterfeer with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98328:72"/>the former. And yet how ſtrictly were you bound by your Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate oathes to auſterity of life, gravity of carriage, brotherly love and accord one with another, eſpecially to incorrupt dealing, as in other matters, ſo chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing your places, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting others into vacant rooms. The thought whereof (as I have been informed by many) gave cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confidence to the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Colledge in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies after receiving a Mandate from her Majeſty to proceed unto an unſtatutable election of one into the houſe, who was uncapable thereof, to call for a pair of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, and to lay the Queens letters in one ſcale, the ſtatute-book in the other, demanding withall of thoſe who were then preſent, which of the two weighed down the other, and replying, that the command of a Prince ought to give place in any thing where our obedience is due to God before. How far different your practiſe hath been on like occaſions from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98328:73"/>this worthy example. I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſpeak, and let one for all teſtifie, who having not long before an Election, encouraged a young youth of meet capacity for the place in all reſpects, and (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) promiſed him his vote againſt another competitor, much inferiour to him every way, age on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, upon an unexpected receit of a letter in the behalf of the latter from a perſon very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for his advantage, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with the higheſt, ſuddenly changed his minde, not bluſhing to ſay, that the former was indeed the more deſerving ſcholar, but he might not by any means diſpleaſe them, which had commended the latter to his choice; although he could not be ignorant what he was bound to do by oath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in this caſe. But this was the generall carriage of things at that time, partly through mens own inclinations, and partly through the remiſſe and corrupt government of their <hi>Praepoſiti</hi> or heads, who for ought as could be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98328:73"/>diſcerned by them, made the leaſt conſcience of any, of keeping their oathes, and acting according to the tenour of them; whether in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to themſelves, or unto others committed to their charge; for they freely tolerated, or at leaſt connived at your manners, how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoever, and contrary to the locall ſtatutes, that ye might be (as in ſeemeth) the more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their unjuſt will after Court-example in another caſe. In the mean time ſuſpecting and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vertuous and ſober men, who conſcionably oppoſed or diſliked their proceedings: which for the generality tended to this, how they might ſerve their ſuperiors in what they did command, without diſputing the lawfulneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe thereof, and ſo make way for their own advancement. And therefore would they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as well by their authority as by their example, draw others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnare, and make them guilty with themſelves of this grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency againſt the Almighty.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98328:74"/>And indeed they wanted not at any time enow or more then enow, who ſtifly adhered to the factions, and readily followed their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious counſels and courſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction or demur, for their own vile and baſe ends. Thus would they both as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, break at pleaſure thoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bonds of conſcience (I mean their more then penall oathes) as <hi>Samſon</hi> did his green withs or new ropes,
<note place="margin">Judg. 16.</note> though many times perchance no fewer then theſe. Now ſuch was the devotion of theſe poor creatures to their unworthy maſters as well in other reſpects as in the former, that they muſt undergoe the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day for them in their Academicall turns of preaching, and likewiſe in their countrey charges on the weekly ſolemnities, not far diſtant from the Univerſity. For (whether it were idleneſſe, or for prelaticall ſtate, or for both theſe, I cannot tell) your gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours began now generally to neglect, if not to deſert, this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98328:74"/>work of the miniſtery, as not pertaining to their office, and though they were well content to receive the profits of many livings year by year, it was done without any noiſe or benefit to the people; Foraſmuch as they ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcharged their duty in one of thoſe ſamiſhed congregations, for whom they are to anſwer and give an exact account to Chriſt at the laſt day. The Lord lay not this ſin to their charge.</p>
               <p>Not inferiour (as I conceive) to your perjury was your falſhood in giving forth the ſame Letters teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall for all men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that requeſted the ſame at your hands: but of far more dangerous conſequence to the Church of Chriſt, which by this means, no doubt, became worſe provided of paſtours in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then any of the reformed Churches throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world. <hi>Sed mulus mulum ſcabit.</hi> Wherefore God gave you up as a prey and ſpoil to thoſe men whom he did in times paſt more deſpiſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98328:75"/>then any living upon the earth: To mercileſſe enemies, who did confound the innocent with the guilty in cenſure and puniſhment; no ingennity of parts, no emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of learning or piety, no true pretence of conſcience could ſerve the turn, and be admitted to plead for them. Every infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was accepted from the falſe brethren; any one, how uncapable ſoever, of the faction, was preferred to what place he beſt liked. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I am informed) did one of them noted for his intemperate zeal, ſtick to ſay, that they muſt not leave one of the old brood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Univerſity: a ſpeech moſt inhumane, as wel as unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, eſpecially conſidering the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof; which was (as time hath ſince made manifeſt) to make way for the introducing in their ſtead a new generation of creatures not much unlike thoſe of whom we read <hi>Mat.</hi>

And oh that ye had tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of them even at this day I but alas, the exceſſe and riot of many of you with other crimes do ſtill teſtifie againſt you, not as yet relinquiſhed by them in any meaſure; no nor concealed from the eyes of the world, though hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to your adverſaries, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious to your ſelves: except neceſſity doth ſometimes lay a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon your power, where will is preſent and ready at all times.</p>

               <p>Ye much boaſt of your dexterity and frequency both in preaching, and unpremeditated praying (a novell rarity in that place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was not acquainted in times paſt, or elſe ſo cloſely lockt up, that few had the knowledge thereof). But granting ſome of you a primacy in the former, I ſuppoſe many of you have cauſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98328:79"/>to bluſh at the mention of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, remembring what miſtakes, impertinencies, tautologies, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequencies, to ſay no worſe, have paſſed from you in this raſh and inconſiderate motion. Although the better adviſed and wiſer ſort among you, to avoid ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences as theſe, are thought to preſent us with compoſed formes of prayer many times, yet ſo as they would have them taken of their Auditors for the iſſues of ſudden meditation; and indeed the phraſe and language of the ſame intimate as much, being for the moſt part more apt and elegant then that which they uſe in their popular Sermons. Wherefore one of your faction and of your ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety heretofore, well reputed of for his learning with you unto this day, did not many years agoe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately impart his minde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this thing to a friend of his well known unto my ſelf (of whom alſo I received it) and that to this effect, to wit, That he had ſo many formes of prayer lying
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98328:80"/>by him, or elſe committed to memory by the enterchangeable uſe of which (notwithſtanding the ſame for words, or but little varying upon ſome ſpeciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) he was thought by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alwaies to pray without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation. How warrantable this deluſion may be with men, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; but with God ſurely it cannot paſſe the note of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and of vain-glory: From which the Apoſtle was ſo free, that he did forbear to ſay the truth in ſuch a caſe as this tending to his own honour, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any man ſhould think of me above that which he ſeeth me to be,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.6.</note> or that he heareth of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be it ſo as ye would have it, this cannot adde either to the efficacy of your prayers, or to the acceptation of your perſons in the preſence of the Almighty: albeit it is to be feared that ſome of you entertain this conceit thereof ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in your hearts, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not condemn, at leaſt ſo peremptorily as they do,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98328:80"/>the uſe of ſet formes in other men. Neither can good and diligent preaching, advantage your ſouls without anſwerable living, though ye never ſo frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently cry down in the Aſſembly, ſelf, and fleſh, and nature, and world, with whatſoever appertaineth to their ſeverall proprieties. I know full well that ye are good at this in the Pulpit (laying aſide your affectation of new coined words, unuſuall tone and geſture; the which ſome have in part relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed for very ſhame) but in your converſation ye are as other men, eſpecially when ye are called upon by your profeſſion for contempt of the world in your practiſe and example. Witneſſe this the leaders and chieftains who brought and ſetled you where ye now abide: For as they did diſplace at pleaſure, all thoſe that did not yeeld to their demands, ſo they wrought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into thoſe places made va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant by them which were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt benefit and advantage, at leaſt moſt opportune for their private
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98328:81"/>ends of covetouſneſſe or ambition. And albeit this might ſeem a point of wiſdome in them to the eyes of the world, I am ſure it was not that <hi>wiſdome which deſcendeth from above,</hi> and which they ſo much commend by their doctrine to the conſcience of others, but that which is from below, even <hi>the wiſdome of this world,
<note place="margin">Jam. 3.15.</note> or of the fleſh,</hi> of which ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.15. And yet perchance it was a kinde of imprudence too, in reſpect of the common cauſe which they did then maintain: the which without doubt could not but ſuffer hereby ſome dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of its former credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with all indifferent men. But it is an hard matter even for the deepeſt diſſemblers to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not to put off their diſguiſe in ſuch concerning caſes as theſe: and therefore having ſo fair and ſingular opportunity of advancing themſelves, they accumulate places of honour and truſt: ſo high was their opinion of their own worth, ſo immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their deſire of worldly wealth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98328:81"/>and greatneſſe, according to the cuſtome of their faction who are generally accounted provident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers, and layers up in ſtore for the future, but niggardly diſpenſers of what they have and can well ſpare to the neceſſities of their poor brethren, whoſe mouthes ſeldome bleſſe you, becauſe their bowels are ſeldome refreſhed by you, but curſe you often becauſe of your frequent incompaſſion towards them. The Lord forgive both you and them. Yea, ſome were known to be penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſordid towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their families, and ſo cruell to their own bowels as well as to other men. Now what good works will follow you after death, according to this account, I need not ſpeak. For your laudable pains in the work of the miniſtery cannot further you in the way of ſalvation,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> without exemplary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life.</p>
               <p>And here we may not paſſe by without juſt cenſure, thoſe men who have contrary to former oathes, entred into others right,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98328:82"/>and poſſeſſed themſelves of their places, violating hereby the ſtatutes of the houſe, which they had ſworn ever to maintain. One of them eminent for place among you, though not for parts, being urged upon a certain occaſion with the ſtatute of the Colledge by another who ſought his right on this ground, and diſputed the caſe as warrantable and juſt from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this nature, was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to reply in defence of the contrary part, that no oathes could binde the conſcience againſt the reformation (a ſtrange reformation that cannot be effected without the groſſe and palpable perjury either of the reformers themſelves, or of them that are to be be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them) For indeed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious manner of living in theſe times, even of the beſt, is not capable of a ſtrict conformity to Colledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatutes formerly eſtabliſhed; ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere and rigid are they, eſpecially ſome of them, and not ſuting with the long accuſtomed looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our age. Inſomuch as it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98328:82"/>were reformation enough, and (as moſt men would count) more then enough, if (Popery and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition laid aſide) men were exacted the obedience only of thoſe ſtatutes which concern mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duty, and behaviour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life one towards another. But notwithſtanding this mans great zeal for the reformation, time hath ſince declared to the world, that neither proteſtation, league, or covenant could ſufficiently binde him for the work againſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, profit, and eaſe. So lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſcience do they ſhew in time of triall, who moſt pretend for it in a more calm and quiet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>As for your Elections, I have not much to witneſſe of them, and yet ſome have feelingly complained in my hearing, that deſert, whether of learning, or of other parts, findes as cold a welcome with you (if poorly attended or elad) as ever it did in times paſt, and that preferment runs as heretofore in the corrupt channell of favour and affection;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98328:83"/>not in that of equity and right. But for this, happily ye may be excuſed in part, as being overſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them whoſe creatures you are; who think it reaſonable, that as ye have ſerved your ſelves of their power when time was, ſo you ſhould by way of compenſation now ſerve their will, and obey their commands; and ſurely how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the caſe ſtandeth, thus much they do expect and require at your hands, as might appear by ſeverall inſtances.</p>
               <p>But enough of this: I have but one word to ſay more, and it is by way of admonition to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and well minded among you, who have been carryed away by errour of the times (an errour diſcernible by the feweſt of men that live in them) unto thoſe practiſes, which they would loath and deteſt if they ſaw the true ſhape of them, (which is ugly and deformed) and were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by falſe glaſſes, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit repreſentations of them in the diſguiſes of juſtice and honeſty;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98328:83"/>but as yet allow, becauſe they are not conſcious to themſelves of any malice or evill intention in what they do, that they would devoutly implore the grace of the Almighty for illumination to ſee, and direction to follow thoſe things which make for their peace, leſt otherwiſe they live and die in their ſin; and what will be the ſequell thereof, they cannot be ignorant, who know the truth and terrour of God. In the mean time let them and all take heed how they manage their preſent fortune, leſt they alſo become a prey to others, as others have been made a prey to them. For it is to be ſeared, that your gaudy proſperity is an eye-ſore unto them, who have power over your eſtates and lives, and will finde matter enough of quarrell againſt you, if there be not a change of manners, and this wrought with diſcretion and ſpeed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this happily ſerve the turn to prevent thoſe deſignes, which (as we hear) are now on
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98328:84"/>foot to alienate the Colledge-lands from publick uſe for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of learning to the propriety of private men, the dangerous effects whereof both to Church and State, not in this preſent age only, but alſo in the generations to come, I tremble to imagine; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I Have but little to ſay to you, being altogether unacquainted with your profeſſion and your wayes.

Nevertheleſſe there hath been a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the people in the land for ſome years paſt, and as lowd as it durſt break forth againſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and oppreſſion of your Courts of Judicature, as if might, or favour, or money could more prevail in them then equity or law, neither is it ſilent unto this day. Whether your ſin were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the clamour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or no, I cannot tell: But of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98328:85"/>this I am aſſured, that God will require much at your hands in the laſt and generall day of Judgment, there being no men alive, who have more frequent and ſignal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of their duty, or alarms of their account before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty then you, beſides the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Obligations of ſolemn Oaths, and common ties upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to doe the thing which is lawfull and right. Happy is it for you now, and for the State in which ye live, and much more happy will it be for you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if ye lay theſe things to heart, and practiſe as you learn and know Judgement and Truth, on which as on the the baſis the Peace and ſafety of every Common-wealth doe reſt, and thruſt aſide, war, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and ruine doe enſue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy.</p>
               <p>Your proceedings are many times intricate and dark, not to be traced by popular and ordinary ſent. There be many windings and turnings in the Law, which few can finde out, mazes and almoſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98328:85"/>inexplicable labyrinths to thoſe who are not guided by your clew. But ſtill remember, who ſtandeth in the midſt of you, even a God that ſeeth in darkneſſe, to whom the darkneſſe and light are both alike, ſecret and hidden things are open and manifeſt,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom they have to doe.</hi> Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eighty ſecond Pſalm be your mirror, wherein to behold what you are, what ye ſhould be, if amiſſe, and not upright accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the minde and will of God. And not hear only, but obey alſo his commands in the Miniſtry of the Word. A time there was, when the ſober admonition and milder reproof of the Preacher would not goe down with ſome of you, but were diſtaſted by your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt palates. And therefore a Miniſter was warned of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan, being then to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges, not to touch upon this ſtring, it liked them
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98328:86"/>not forſooth to hear that which did pertain to their office and duty, or rather did tacitly check their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and tranſgreſſion thereof ſo often repeated in their eares. Who were moſt faulty in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the Judges that did refuſe to be admoniſhed, the Biſhop who adviſed the Miniſter to gratifie them in their deſire, or the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter if he did obey the will of his ſuperiour in this thing, let God judge. But I preſume it was not after this manner every where, nor with all perſons, neither did it (as I ſuppoſe) continue thus long. And God forbid this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and neceſſary liberty ſhould be diminiſhed or reſtrained in any part thereof. For can men too often hear of that, which they are to doe at all times? and which is of everlaſting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them? <hi>Bee inſtructed therefore ye Judges of the earth,

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98328:89"/>what thronging and thruſting for places and ſeates approximate to the Preacher? what earneſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sermon? what demure carriage all the while is ſeen in the Aſſembly? how many diligent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries are preſent to receive, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever droppeth from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters lips? what ſighing may you hear oftentimes, and groaning of the Auditours? what expreſſions may we behold almoſt in every countenance of ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe? what elevation of the eyes to heaven? And yet alas how ſoone is all this vaniſhed and forgotten? For after one nights ſleep (notwithſtanding repetition in private houſes of what was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely delivered in the Church, and other acts of duty proper for the ſeaſon there performed by them) they return with all gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to their wonted courſes of unjuſt dealing and unlawfull gaine, by lying, falſhood, perjury, deceit, equivocations, mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, meerly Jeſuiticall, and almoſt to as bad a purpoſe, though
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98328:90"/>not upon ſo great neceſſity. Thus like the Gallant they ſeem at the Church porch to bid Religion ſtay there for them untill they come thither again, as often as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the houſe of God, or at the moſt retain but a weak and faint reliſh thereof untill the day be over paſt: ſo little doe they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of what they learn in their life, all the week after, as if the whole buſineſs of Chriſtianity did conſiſt in nothing elſe then in hearing, or talking of what we ought to doe, and not in obedience of the Truth.</p>
               <p>But they will be ready to ſay, we have private and conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions at home, as well as thoſe we uſe in the Lords houſe, and therefore all our Religion doth not reſt on publique duty.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge in their own defence doth make the more againſt them, for what is this your daily exerciſe of devotion, but an hypocriticall profanation of holy duties, when you uſe it for a pretence onely of Religion, for a ſhew of piety, or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98328:90"/>rather for a veil of iniquity. Surely ſuch ſeigned holineſſeas this is as diſtaſt full to the Almighty as open profaneneſſe:
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.14.</note> And indeed no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God can profit us, or ſtand us in the leaſt ſtead, without ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy towards man, as appeareth from <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. and from many places more of holy writ, which plainly tell us that where innocence and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity are wanting in the Perſon, there can be no acceptance of the Action before God, whatſoever it be for the naure and quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In a word, the ſubſtance of our Chriſtian Profeſſion conſiſteth in obeying the practicall precepts of the Goſpell from <hi>faith unſeigned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.5.</note> And this to obey is much better then any ſacrifice and oblation of prayer or praiſe we can offer to the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the faction of thy children, proceding from thy pride and aboundance of all things, to which ſome impute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſufferings of thy Nation, it is ſtrange to conſider by what ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98328:91"/>wiers and ſubtill motions it hath been conveyed through thy whole corporation; and though it be more then probable that worldly intereſt is moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the ſeverall oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet every one is taught to open his mouth wide for the cauſe and truth of God, and none more then they who moſt blaſpheme his name by their impure doctrines, which they commend to the world for thoſe of Chriſt Jeſus, though as contrary to what he ſpake as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to light. And becauſe theſe are the fruits of faction and ſchiſm ſometimes, (as it is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent with us) as well as the cauſes thereof at other times, I wiſh men all to remember how deep and ſad their accounts will one day be, who have any wayes procured theſe dangerous maladies to the State and Church, or fomented the ſame by word or deed. For wee plainly ſee to what condition both are reduced at this preſent, and every man may be ſo far a Prophet as to ſoretel yet greater calamities like

Nor ſhall I labour to diſſolve the Adamantine hearts of thy creditours into humane pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards their poore obnoxious debters.

               <p>WEre I now to addreſſe my ſpeech to an humble though deceived people, I might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope to prevail with them: but I am to deal with men who generally are proud as well as ignorant, and have added to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in judgement, obſtinacy of will, and a ſtrong preſumption of truth; arrogating to themſelves immediate aſſiſtance and infallible direction from the divine Spirit in what they maintain for the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98328:95"/>undoubted Goſpell of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And who can ſhake this your conſidence? Nevertheleſſe I ſhall endevour as powerfully as I can, to convince you of your ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit and falſhood, and perſwade you to another, but ſounder mind, leaving the ſucceſſe to him, with whom all things are poſſible and eaſie to be done: Firſt then let me enquire of you, why ye did ſo long adhere unto this Church in times paſt, and why ye are ſo ſoon removed from it as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What is the cauſe of your forrner communion with us, and your ſudden departure from us? Surely the firſt muſt needs argue great weakneſſe of judgement, and want of conſideration in you; and how ye can defend the laſt from the juſt imputation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtableneſſe in religion and levity of mind, is more then I can learn you. If your new pretended Paſtours, and (as you deem them) extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teachers in reſpect of their calling, deliver you the ſame truths which ye received or might
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98328:96"/>have received from the old, why are they better accepted with you now then heretofore? or why are they better taken at the hands of the former then of the latter? Is it for the grace and manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or for their perſons who commend the ſame unto you? If either, or both of theſe be the cauſe of this change; do ye not <hi>look on things after the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cot. 10.7. Joh. 7.24.</note> and not <hi>judge righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> You will ſay perchance, that the power of the Almighty doth manifeſt it ſelf unto them, becauſe though ignorant and unlearned men they pray and preach with the ſame facility or with more dexterity ſometimes then men of learning and parts; But can ye ſhew us that God did ever work a needleſſe miracle, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his truth, or witneſſing it to the world? Hath any man ſpake with tongues, or done mighty ſigns and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God, ſince the Goſpel was preached to all
<note n="*" place="margin">See 1 Cor. 14.12.</note> nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If ye know ſuch a one produce
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98328:96"/>him without delay, that we may ſee alſo and beleeve him with you. But this is not likely to come to paſſe, however (as I am informed) ſome have gone about, though in vain, to perſwade us the truth of things as incredible as theſe to juſtifie their cauſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, who will take you to be competent judges of thoſe gift; in other men, whereof ye have ſo ſmall a portion your ſelves, or perchance no ſhare at all? Laſtly, the means of knowledge in this nation, have been ſo plentifull and common every where for many years together (Bleſſed be the Lord for this his unſpeakable gift) partly by the teaching, and partly by the writing of the learned, that it is an eaſie matter now for men of good naturall parts with ordinary incluſtry uſed in hearing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what is taught them by mouth, or in reading what is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed from the preſſe, to gaine enough whereby to ſet themſelves forth with credit and repute of knowledge for a time in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery

For beſides that this pride of ſpirit doth lay you open to their ſlie and dangerous inſinuations of hereſie, and every falſe doctrine whereby they do impoſe upon your faith, it is an abomination in the ſight of the Almighty, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Luk. 19.9, &amp;c.</note> And ſurely it is almoſt beyond all belief how far this tympany of ſpiritual pride hath ſwoln in many of you: or that they have imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in a ſtate of perfection above divine ordinances, namely, prayer, preaching, Sacraments, and if there be any other act of duty
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98328:98"/>pertaining to the worſhip of God, notwithſtanding the Apoſtles and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, doe every where commend and command the uſe of theſe to the Church, not by their precept only, but by their example alſo; for how often doe we finde it teſtified of the Lord by thoſe who were from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>eye-witneſſes</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of the word,</hi> as the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Luk.</hi>

<note place="margin">Mat. 10.24, 25.</note> For, <hi>the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord.

               <p>And now conſider with me I pray you, the perilous conſequence of your ſchiſme or ſeparation from the Church, to the renouncing of the miniſtry and baptiſme which ye received firſt from it. For if our Church be indeed a true Church, what have ye done leſſe in thus deſerting it, then renounced Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? as appeareth from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. where we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the ground and foundation of every true Church: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. where we perceive the firſt originall of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power in the Church, and how far the contempt thereof rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, even unto God himſelf.

Wherefore no man can teach with profit as a Miniſter, no man can baptize but a Miniſter in the Church of God, who hath by the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who did not preach himſelf before he was ſent,
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.21.</note> and but for that he was ſent.</p>
               <p>You ſee then clearly how much you hazard your moſt precious
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98328:99"/>ſouls in forſaking our Church, if it be a true Church; and in caſe it be a falſe one, ye have neither judgement to diſcern, nor reaſon to prove that it is ſo either for your own, or other mens ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this point; and (as I do beleeve) no man living upon the face of the whole earth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſay the truth, your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and want of due inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the firſt, was the true and main cauſe of your ſeduction and ſchiſme: for who have more fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off from fellowſhip with us, then thoſe that were never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the principles of our faith, and grounds of the doctrine which we profeſſe? And though ye pretend indeed, that the Antichriſtian calling, falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ſcandalous living of our Miniſters, gave you juſt cauſe of ſeparating from us; the former upon examination would prove loud and lewd ſlanders of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or of malice; and as for the latter, it cannot excuſe you in this matter before God, as appeareth

For I wel remember, that a certain woman of your faction, in diſcourſe at the table with my ſelf and others maintaining a point of doctrine not agreeable to the Analogie of faith, and being urged to the contrary by us with the words of Chriſt and of his Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter:</hi> replyed, that ſhe did regard what Chriſt ſpake, but as for that which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, ſhe gave no more heed to it, and cared no more for

               <p>As for the Apoſtaſie of ſome, it is ſo great and generall, that they ſeem wholly to degenerate from the profeſſion of Chriſt Jeſus or to Atheiſme and utter unbelief of the truth. For who can excuſe them that are termed Ranters from this dreadfull imputation, that ſhall recount the damnable tenents, which they maintain, and practiſes wherein they glory; the which to mention or expreſſe were to defile the paper whereon I write? ſurely theſe (if any now) are the men whom <hi>God hath given over to a reprobate minde,

               <p>HE that doth but indifferently obſerve the manner and courſe of your lives (O ye ſinfull Engliſh people) ſhall generally finde you to be ſuch as walk quite contrary to the light and truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, which ye do profeſſe and have vowed to maintain. For firſt ye are either openly profane in your converſation, not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining but abhorring from the appearance of that which is good, or put on the rough garment of ſeeming ſanctity and auſterity of life, to deceive the credulous part of the world by this diſguiſe of hypocriſie in a good opinion of you: the better to accompliſh your ambitious or covetous ends. And therefore to ſwear raſhly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98328:102"/>without adviſe or cauſe is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with many as their ordinary ſpeech. The neglect and contempt of Gods worſhip both publick and private, with the Miniſters thereof more notorious then ever, as may appear by the following inſtance. For the vulgar country people make it no matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience on the Lords day to abſent themſelves from the congregation as often as they liſt, upon the leaſt, and without any juſt pretence whatſoever, and come thither <hi>pas a pas,</hi> like their oxe, ſlowly and tardily at the beſt, although they will be ſure to be at their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in due ſeaſon, and therefore haſten to them with nimble pace and meaſure; yea, like men affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſometimes or purſued by their enemies, with like motion doe they precipitate themſelves or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly depart out of the Church aſſoon, and frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Miniſters bleſſing: And during their preſence at the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, good God, what drowſineſſe, want of attention, ſporting, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98328:102"/>wandring of the eyes after every perſon that entreth in, gazing upon the habit and countenance of thoſe that are preſent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and other irreverent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures may we perceive in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory? As for thoſe who by their coming, anticipate the time of divine ſervice, or tarry after it in or near the place thereof: they wholly minde their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſcourſing of their land, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, corn, bargains of the ſeaſon, weather, and ſuch like, to omit worſe matters, though theſe be bad enough, ſo little do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member or regard for what end they came to the Church, what they heard there, and to whom they muſt one day give an account for both. And in this particular as well as in many other, the moſt profeſſed enemies of our Religion, the <hi>Turks</hi> will condemn you at the laſt day, who at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon devotions, count it no ſmall treſpaſſe againſt the Majeſty and honour of God, ſo much as to ſcratch the head, or to uſe any
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98328:103"/>other indecent or impertinent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, imagining their prayers by this means to become ineffectuall and fruitleſſe for them before the throne of the Almighty,

And for this cauſe they will uſually tranſgreſſe the bounds of a ſabbath daies journey in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to ſome other remote Church, there to ſerve God as they pretend upon any worldly occaſions, or concerning profane buſineſſe of commerce and ſuch like, when they will ſcarce make a ſtep out of their houſes to their own congregation, though the place or Church be never ſo neer unto them, unleſſe perchance they have an errand to do there of the ſame nature with the former. Thus God is ſerved in pretence, but the world in truth, or in deed; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Devill, who ſetteth them a work, though upon their own buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now what groſſe ignorance doth every where blinde the eyes of this people? For many, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98328:103"/>they have been ſo long accuſtomed to the hearing of Sermons, and can yeeld you an orall confeſſion of their faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding no more what they ſay, though in their mother tongue, then their ſorefathers did, of that which they were taught by their Prieſts, to repeat in a ſtrange and unknown language; neither can they diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>precept</hi> and a <hi>prayer,</hi> but uſually confound both as one in their oriſons and private devotions. Hence it is that they ſcarce look higher then to the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in all their waies, giving them ſeaſonable weather, and fruitfull ſeaſons, with other common bleſſings of life, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding theſe from them, when he is diſpleaſed with them for their ſins. In the mean time they are altogether ſenſleſſe of his ſaving grace in Chriſt Jeſus: and as they ſeel not the want, ſo it is to be ſeared that they never obtain the benefit thereof. And indeed they wilfully cloſe their eyes againſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98328:104"/>the light, either groſſely neglecting, or obſtinately refuſing to know more then they do, at leaſt ſo much as they ought. For they neither reſpect nor make uſe of a miniſter for his gifts, whereby he is able to inſtruct them, nor conſider the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and unſpeakable benefit of his office in order to a better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then this preſent life, but if he be a man given to hoſpitality, no exacter of his tithes, eaſie and willing to be deceived in matter of contract and right, they more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him for this bounty, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of manners, then for all the good he can do them in reference to their precious ſouls, like thoſe of whom we read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.26. that <hi>followed Chriſt for his meat,</hi> not for his <hi>miracles and doctrine.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men of the other temper have been very evilly entreated by them in theſe obnoxious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Bible is laid aſide by the ruder ſort, as well in reſpect of domeſtick uſe as of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick practiſe, and where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98328:104"/>into their houſes, and read at certain ſeaſons, it is a ſhame to ſee how ſlovenly it is toſſed up and down, and ſoyled by thoſe places where it is careleſly thrown as if it were ſome baſe utenſil of the kitchin, or of ſome other room belonging to the houſe, not a pearl of that price whereat every ſober Chriſtian doth eſteem it, or at leaſt ought to do. And I would to God this were not a generall fault throughout the Nation, and the Index of a greater; I mean the inward ſlighting of that word which we outwardly thus vilifie and diſgrace: for although I ſhould be loth to perſwade others, or allow in them a ſuperſtitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veverence towards the Book; ſuch as the Turks uſe towards their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran (who count it an horrible crime for any man, though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, to ſit upon it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Busbiq.</hi> Ep. 1.</note> and puniſh the ſame with death in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:) yet I cannot but minde you of that which is comely and agreeable to the nature of the thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we muſt needs bewray
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98328:105"/>a kinde of irreligion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that which is holy, and give occaſion of ſcandall to thoſe who are of different profeſſion from us: wherefore it is ſtoried of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, that godly young Prince and firſt reformer of this Church, that being upon ſome occaſion to look out at a window in a houſe where he was, and having a Bible brought to him to ſtand thereon for his better conveniency of ſight, he utterly refuſed to make uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for this purpoſe, but devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſſing it, in the preſence of them that ſtood by, he laid it down on the place again: a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly royall example of piety, by which he ſhewed how great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe the world might have expected from his future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if God had not then judged him too good for an earthly, and counted him worthy to receive an heavenly kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now concerning your demeanure towards the Miniſters of the Lord Chriſt, it may very well ſeeme
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98328:105"/>very incredible to all men of other profeſſions in the world, to whom ye give place for love and honour, uſually given to ſuch as ſerve them in holy things, that I may not ſay far outſtrip and goe beyond any of them in malice and miſchief to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your ſpirituall Guides, eſpecially of late years ſince you have had more free and ſafe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing your diſaffection to them, or ſpleen againſt them, then in preceding times. It hath ever been your practiſe received from your forefathers to remove (as much as in you lay) the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Land-mark, and to entrench upon the bounds and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Clergy; and this ye have done by concealment of known rights belonging to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by pretended, but falſe preſcription and cuſtome againſt both humane and Divine Law, by Defalcation of Tithes, unjuſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or detention of them, evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, colluſions, and by other wayes as bad as theſe. But now ye deſire a releaſe of this debt, or non-payment
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98328:106"/>thereof, ſome (as they make ſhew) for conſcience ſake, becauſe it is in their account part of the Leviticall Law, or of the old Jewiſh bondage from which they are wholly exempt by Chriſt Jeſus, others for no other end either in ſhew or in truth, then to ſpare this coſt of Religion, and to lay the gaine to their own private treaſures. And ſurely we have cauſe to beleive that if the common Countrey people might be freed from this ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full penſion, or might Tithes (as they ſpeak) be laid aſleep, they would not much care, if the Miniſtry alſo ſlept with the ſame; for as they count the one an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream burden to their purſes, and therefore never yet paid Tithes with a willing minde: ſo they feel the other a burden to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from which they would be delivered, did not a ſuperiour fear limit and reſtrain them in this impious deſire and ungodly will; For they cannot endure to ſee a Miniſter thrive by their labour, though pining with his owne,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98328:106"/>and for their ſakes in the Lords harveſt.</p>
               <p>As for the other ſort, whoſe conſcience (as they profeſſe) will not permit them to be Tithers according to the Law by which we are governed, for fear of ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to a Ceremoniall rite or duty now abrogated by the Goſpel, it is ſtrange to conſider, both how vain their fear is in this caſe, becauſe this burden is not impoſed on them by virtue of the Moſalcall Law, but by the civill Power for the maintenance of the Goſpel; neither can it be proved, that it is a part of that ſhadow, whereof Chriſt is the Body; and alſo how falſe their pretence is of Chriſtian tenderneſſe in this buſineſſe, becauſe the ſame perſons who alleadge againſt the Miniſters that they receive of the people, that portion which was properly due to the Leviticall Prieſthood, doe at the ſame time complaine that they pay more now to the Miniſter under the Goſpell, then the Jewes did to the Prieſt under
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98328:107"/>the Law, namely, a fifth for their tenth part; which if true, the rate is much different now from what it was then, and they do apparently pluck down with one hand, what they built up with the other. But the truth is, that which ye both driveat, and all the people of this once flouriſhing Iſland together with them, is how ye may ſerve the Lord at the eaſieſt hand. A cheap religion, by which ye may ſave moſt, and thrive beſt for the world, wherein is leaſt trouble and moſt gain, doth alone ſuit with your carnall diſpoſitions and earthly mindes, although (as one well ſaid) he that thinketh to ſave any thing by his Religion but his ſoule, will prove a loſer in the end. And yet we have known a man in our times below the rank and quality of a Gentleman, who year by year pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Miniſter a free will offering of that value, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore would have been accounted a liberall ſtipend for a ſerving Curate, and doth now paſſe for a tolerable ſalary in Gentlemens
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98328:107"/>houſes for a Domeſtick Chaplain, eſpecially where the Patron is a man of the novel profeſſion Of a far different and worſe mind was that witleſſe and graceleſſe Juſtice (if I miſtake not) of the County of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was not aſhamed to ſay openly at the meeting of his fellow Commiſſioners, that he valued the labour of a Miniſter no more then he did two dayes work of a day-labouring man. But happily there be many more of the ſame minde with this young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, although they have more diſcretion then to utter it thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he did; as for the other I muſt confeſſe, I have not as yet found a companion for him, and know not where to ſeek one. And now I ſhall take a further view of your wicked practiſes againſt thoſe who have faithfully ſerved you in the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The time was when your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors made a lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (as they term it) by way of ſupplication to the High Court of Parliament for a learned Miniſtry,
<note place="margin">A Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1585.</note>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:98328:108"/>and withall requeſted that the full maintenance of Tithes, might be again reſtored to the Church, with what intention, God knoweth to whom I leave it. But the time is come in which you their unhappy poſterity delight more in unlearned then in learned Miniſters, and many of you have made humble addreſſes to the preſent power, that ye might be freed from the decimal charge as too grievous for you to bear, and more then the neceſſities of the Paſtour, or (as you imagine perchance) the dignity of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doth require. And however the reſt were cloſe or ſilent in the matter, it is juſtly ſuſpected by ſome, that it was not ſo much the love of the Miniſtry, as fear leſt they ſhould be only poaſted off to more rigorous exacters of this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not eaſed of the burden which deterred them from joining with then former in the ſame requeſt. But this happily may ſeem rather a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of covetouſneſs for your ſelves, the of malice againſt your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or indeed a pernicious effect of both; your other proceedings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98328:108"/>lowdly publiſh and proclaim to the world the malice and bitterneſs of your ſpirits againſt them. For with what eagerneſſe of minde and earneſt endeavour have ye proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ejection of many a worthy labourer in Gods harveſt out of his lawfull poſſeſſion? And by how ſlight means have ye ſet on foot, yea and accompliſhed alſo your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſignes? ſometimes by ſlender and uncertain informations brought againſt them, otherwhile by frivolous accuſations, and ſometime again by falſe imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of malignancy, popery, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and of ſuch like crimes, laid to their charge, from which they were altogether free, not without the ſubornation of falſe witneſſes ſometimes to atteſt the ſame. And in caſe new matters of ſcandall were wanting, whereby to make them odious to the ruling Power, thoſe which time had almoſt buried in oblivion, were revived again by you to the infamy and damage of your Paſtors, as if they were not men compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with infirmity, as well as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98328:109"/>others, or your ſelves free from all iniquity, not needing the mercy of him who is the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of you both, and though ye need it, how can ye with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence expect it, if that be true as ye finde,
<note place="margin">Jam. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For he ſhall have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy?</hi> For neither your <hi>words</hi> nor <hi>deeds</hi> have been ſuch toward them as doe become men that ſhall be <hi>judged by the law of Liberty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> becauſe ye have uſed rigour and extremity in them both, not adviſing in the leaſt meaſure with the Law of Chriſt: For otherwiſe ye would not have aggravated after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner every ſmall matter which might any wayes tend to their prejudice, but rather have paſſed by ſuch as theſe, and either concealed the greateſt where there was hope of repentance and amendment, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame with all meckneſs and moderation conſidering the perſons whom ye did purſue, and the ſad calamities which were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to befall them and their families, if judgement ſhould proceed againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:98328:109"/>
               <p>And ſurely it is ſtrange that the painfull induſtry of many years in the work of the Miniſtry could not prevail either with you who did partake thereof to conceal, or with thoſe that were their Judges, and without doubt knew as much, to pardon one or a few errours of their life upon promiſe of more ſtrict converſation for the time to come. Ye did pretend indeed that zeal for the Truth onely, and love of Gods people did ſet you thus in oppoſition againſt the ſcandalous Miniſters, or thoſe whom ye were pleaſed to term ſo: but I fear, your own conſcience will one day tell you plainly (and I pray God not too late) that private quarrels, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſts, and ſelf ends carried you all along in theſe unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courſes of miſchief and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; for ſome of you, to our knowledge, who have been moſt forward to thruſt forth of the Lords inheritance them that for many years together had miniſtred unto you in holy things, have been the firſt that fell into diſlike of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98328:110"/>their owne new choice, and refuſed to give them maintenance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law. So weak and unſtable is your judgement, ſo ſickle your affection, ſo immoderate your deſire of novelty, ſo blinde your conſcience in diſcerning your own hearts, ſo ſqueamiſh your mindes to receive truth, if it doth any wiſe make againſt your worldly advantage, or touch upon your ſins, the which though never ſo grievous and manifeſt,
<note place="margin">Hoſ 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>no man muſt ſtrive, or repove another: for thy people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi>

               <p>Neither are ye offended onely with the Miniſter for open, but alſo for ſecret rebukes, yea and for private admonitions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptions ſometimes, be they never ſo neceſſary and gentle withall, as I have ſeen it by often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence verified in many; one more eſpecially, a very lewd perſon indeed, who being mildly reproved by a Miniſter in my hearing for ſome ſcandalous ſin, replyed again; It were better for us if ye Miniſters held your peace, becauſe then we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98328:110"/>might ſin with the leſſe guilt and puniſhment. To whom then ſhall I ſpeak and give warning that they may hear? <hi>Behold,

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98328:111"/>changed their Miniſters as often, if not more often then there be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the year, and yet ſcarce afford maintenance for a ſingle man to live with them. It is paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief what fooliſh exceptions they have had againſt thoſe men who have upon triall, or other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions preached before them; beſides many againſt ſeverall Miniſters, this they had againſt one not unknown to my ſelf (if I am not miſinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that he preached too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Text.

               <p>And here I may not paſſe by in ſilence a common but very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errour that poſſeſſeth your mindes, whereby ye fondly and falſely imagine that the ſucceſſe of the Miniſtry doth depend upon the perſonall gifts of the Miniſter, and not wholly upon the ordinance

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98328:112"/>as we have found by experience. But to ſlight admonitions of this nature, is almoſt every mans guilt, however ſcarce accounted of as a crime by any. The truth is, ye would fain have, and ſome openly declare as much, a religion exempt as well from duty as from charges and expence, ye would goe to heaven, and yet ſtirre not one foot in the journey, receive the reward of glory, but do no work of grace for it. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your frequent confeſſions and proteſtations of faith in God, many are yet found among you who give more credit to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Diviners and Aſtrologers, though ſeldome but falſe, and ever uncertain, then to the writings of the Prophets and Evangeliſts, and more ſeek unto ſuch as theſe then to their Maker in the time of their diſtreſſe.</p>

For ye have a long time turned the grace of your God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and you plainly ſee that the light beginneth now to ſhine much more dim then formerly, and not at all in many corners of the land, and is there not juſt cauſe to fear,

            <head>A Poſt-ſcript to the Reader.</head>
            <p>HE that undertaketh freely to reprove the faults of many, muſt expect the various cenſures of many, and ſo do I, but fear them not, and truſt I have no cauſe much to paſſe by them, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe that I have had a tender reſpect in what I write to the glory of God, unto truth, and to the ſpirituall good of my brethren,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 74.25.</note> as one that hath <hi>obiained mercy of the Lord to be ſaithfull:</hi> yet as a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with infirmity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many failings, though in the preſent buſineſſe free from malice or deſire of revenge,
<pb facs="tcp:98328:126"/>neither do I plead guiltleſſe my ſelf, while I thus ſeem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe others. Far be this from me, as already it is. I know and acknowledge my own ſins in thoſe of other men, with whom God knoweth, I have been in too great a meaſure guilty of the common errors of the times, whereby we have mutually drawn downe the paſt and preſent judgements, which the Lord hath executed, and doth ſtill execute upon this ſinfull nation,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.3</note> and <hi>my tranſgreſſion is ever before me.</hi> But bleſſed be his name for that I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his fatherly rebukes and chaſtiſements, both to loath and to leave the follies and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my youth. And oh that I were as free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred corruption of my heart! But alas, it ſtill cleaveth very cloſe unto me: and I have
<pb facs="tcp:98328:126"/>found it by experience in my ſelf more difficult to ſtruggle with it, and to ſtrive againſt it with ſucceſſe, then to bear the croſſe, or to ſuffer reproach and perſecution from men for the Name of Chriſt Jeſus. For I am by nature very prone to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency, eſpecially at certain ſeaſons; and this I look upon as my worſt enemy here on earth, againſt which I pray and fight continually. As for thoſe that have any way done me wrong either in goods, or in good name, or any way elſe beſides,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 59 3.</note> 
               <hi>(not for my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor for my ſin O Lord)</hi> I freely forgive them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Almighty, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pour forth a ſupplication for them before the throne of grace. In the mean while comforting my ſelf in this,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> that <hi>I have wronged no man, corrupted no
<pb facs="tcp:98328:127"/>man, defrauded no man:</hi> and waiting for the appearance of <hi>that day wherein every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.13.</note> and the fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is.</hi> And ſurely I might much more comfortably endure mine own afflictions, did not the thought of preſent publick calamities, and of thoſe that are likely to follow upon the head of theſe, perplex my minde, and adde a great weight to the burden of the former. For God hath apparently declared his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt the nation by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the naturall courſe of things in the ſeaſons of the year, in our bodies, and in what not beſides theſe? It is hard to tell whether the like immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drought as of late hath ever been known in the land before, the moſt aged are ſilent and
<pb facs="tcp:98328:127"/>wonder at it with cauſe enough of admiration and aſtoniſhment. Now that both this and our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſickneſſes are the ſure effects of Gods wrath and curſe upon us, appeareth from <hi>Dent.</hi> 28.22.23. Neither may we hope for better things, but are ſtill to expect worſe then theſe which have already befallen us, becauſe <hi>our ſin</hi> like that of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> is <hi>written with a pen of iron,
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.1.</note> and with the point of a diamond, it is graven upon the table of our heart.</hi> The Lord take not his peace from us, as he did from them, even loving kindneſſe and mercies.</p>
            <p>Some indeed glory much in the ſucceſſe of the Army hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto very great and ſtrange, and promiſe as much, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much more from them for the future, as alſo from the Navie. In like manner they
<pb facs="tcp:98328:128"/>count much upon the prudence and policy of thoſe who ſit at the ſtern, but ſin nevertheleſſe unrepented of by the people, and unreformed by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth ſtill threaten us with wrath and vengeance from the Almighty. And what ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard can a Navie at Sea, though never ſo well ſet forth, or an Army on foot in the land, how numerous and reſolute ſoever, afford us from the Lord of ſea and land?
<note place="margin">Job 9. 13.</note> 
               <hi>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do ſtoop under him:</hi> What wiſdome, underſtanding, or counſell againſt him, that <hi>diſappointeth the devices of the crafty,
<note place="margin">Ch. 5.12, 13, 14.</note> ſo that their hands cannot perform their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe:</hi> who <hi>taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſſe: and the counſell of the froward is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong. They meet with
<pb facs="tcp:98328:128"/>darkneſſe in the day time, and grope in the noone-day as in the night.
<note place="margin">Job 9.4.</note> He is wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength: who hath hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath proſpered?</hi> What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in any thing before him, who hath curſed all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence but that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him?
<note place="margin">Ch. 8.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrites hope ſhall periſh: whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a ſpiders web, and their hope as the giving up of the ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Ch. 11.20.</note> or a puffe of breath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that duely conſidereth the ſtate of things in this land immediately preceding the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall devaſtations by forain invaſion, and ſhall compare the ſame with our preſent times, may finde that correſpondency between them, which will juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:98328:129"/>make him fear, leſt the time of our deſolation be at hand alſo; but I forbear, and God forbid. I have but one word more to ſpeak unto thee, and it is by way of requeſt, that if thou be learned, thou wilt not be offended with the rudeneſſe of the ſtile, and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar plainneſs of the expreſſion which thou findeſt in this book, remembring that the major part, whom it doth concern, are either the ignorant, and more ſimple ſort of people, or not ſo knowing as thoſe who have diligent education and training up in the ſchooles of Philoſophy, or of more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite literature. And whoſoever thou be that doſt peruſe this little treatiſe, if by reflexion thou chance to ſee thoſe ſpots and blemiſhes in thy ſelfe, of which thou tookeſt no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:98328:129"/>before, or in caſe thou didſt perceive them, paſſe them by unregarded, never ſeeking to wipe them off from thee; doe not with brutiſh fury, or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh indignation break the glaſs in pieces for being true unto thee; but rather imitate in this particular him, who doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and hold the ſame before thee, that is, reform what is uncomely, purifie what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, rectifie what is a miſſe by the Image or ſhape, which it doth repreſent unto thy view: <hi>Who ſo loveth instruction,
<note place="margin">Prov. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> loveth knowledge, but he that hateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is brutiſh.</hi> It is an hard matter, as the caſe now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtandeth with us, either to ſpeak or to hear Truth as wee ought, ſo great and common is mens prejudice againſt it. And what <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of in his time, may juſtly give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb facs="tcp:98328:130"/>of complaint to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live. <hi>Tam imbecilla ſunt judicia hujus temporis, ac penè tam nulla, ut qui legunt, non tam conſiderant quid legant, quam cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus legant, nec tam dictionis vim atque virtutem, quam dictatoris cogitent dignitatem. Praefat. ad Salom.</hi> Finally, if thou receive any benefit by what thou readeſt herein, give glory to God, and pray for the Author, as he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, and for thoſe who have reviled and deſpitefully uſed him without a cauſe. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with thy ſpirit.
